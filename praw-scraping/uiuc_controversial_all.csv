2022-01-15 12:39:03,https://redd.it/s4qy6o,7,covid booster requirement,did anyone else get fully vaccinated but doesnt wanna get the booster i was trying to find a workaround not getting the booster but think everything is too risky since an email states if you received all your doses in the state of illinois and you already have a verified vaccine record on file you do not need to upload your booster record to the mymckinley portal at this time all illinoisbased vaccines should be automatically captured in the mckinley medicat system i was thinking i may just wait it out since it doesnt look like we quite need it yet and it is not yet required for building access maybe we get enough people to not take it and see what they do

2022-03-24 23:23:48,https://redd.it/tndxlq,1,am i allowed to feel this way,i got stood up am i asking too much for basic human decency it seems like there is this cultural attitude in the us or with people in general that it is ok to not consider peoples feelings or not backupfulfill what one says in other words its ok to not mean what you say maybe this is a raving of a madman but i dont care ive had it with this fakeness and the lack of being honest and straightforward with people earlier this month one of my classmates blocked me and i asked my friends if i did anything wrong or said anything out of pocket that warranted it and my therapist about this and they agreed that i didnt this girl separate from the one that stood me up that i was interested in and was talking to said she wanted to be friends i asked her if she actually meant that or if she is just saying this just to be nice and i got no response whatsoever it shocks me that so many people just say things for the sake of saying things because we dont want to be looked at as a bad person or dont want to be thought of as a bad person whether it be from ourselves or other people even if we dont mean to fulfill what we say with the person that stood me up i wonder why its ok to not say anything it isnt hard for one to say they arent interested and thats ok but dont go saying youll do something if you have no intentions of fulfilling it its dishonest and if anyone is reading this and thinking that that person doesnt owe me anything theyre wrong i deserve basic human decency i have feelings and emotions that i struggle with and im not just another random bystander or background character im afraid if someone were to look at this theyre afraid im sort of bad person i promise you i stray far away from that as much as possible and am not trying to come off as that im just writing this as someone that is hurt and has a bunch of other stuff going on in their life whether it be from the past or present it just shocks me how so many other people like this are not considerate of other people and it makes me question whether they think if what they are thinking is ok or if they try to rationalize their behavior and actions without asking and taking into account that maybe what they are doing is wrong and hurting other people ive had these thoughts in my mind for a while now and maybe now that i am down now i have the courage to write them out i dont know maybe i am crazy for having these thoughts

2013-05-01 14:09:23,https://redd.it/1dhzbl,8,does ruiuc misuse downvoting,edit before you decide to downvote please read this before you miss the point reading the thread this subreddit sucks now httpwwwredditcomruiuccomments1da7i5thissubredditsucksnow i found numerous comments of people having this issue and i think i speak for a lot of people by asking for clarity correct me if im wrong but upvoting is the equivalent to a like on facebook not doing anything means i dont like this or its not of interest to me downvoting is this is completely irrelevant or this adds absolutely nothing to the conversation and thats generally how it works on most other subreddits but on ruiuc too often i find comments downvoted when people express unpopular opinions even though they do contribute to the discussion or worst yet i find posts that are relevant to uiuc being downvoted with no comment explaining why this is happening this happens most often with different events and contests on the campus i think redfrogmario said it best people on this subreddit will downvote anything that they dont care about and upvote anything about suburban express i posted an event page the other day and this happens with most events posted here and it got downvoted mind you i dont care about the internet points i just want my event to get some attention so when people downvote because they dont care about it it makes it difficult for others to see who might care about it i just wish people realized that the upvote means i support and like this and the downvote means this is a trollis not adding to the uiuc conversation i propose that we dont downvote something unless its completely irrelevant to uiuc and if we dont like it just leave it alone

2018-03-01 16:14:09,https://redd.it/819a04,20,response to geos claims,so reading through the last round of discussion on feb 24th i strongly feel that the geo is being utterly unreasonable in many of its demands httpuiucgeoorgwpcontentuploads201802adminscomprehensivesettlementproposalpdf 1 geo wants pay to increase from 16k to 17k for a 9 month 20 hour per week appointment ok sure everyone wants more money but the reasoning that this is 5000 less than the cost of living for our area is ridiculous with the new tax rules only the last 4k of that 16k is going to get taxed at 10see httpswwwforbescomsitesrobertberger20171217thenew2018federalincometaxbracketsrates64663924292a so your federal tax bill will be 400 plus il state which is around 800 that means youll have around 14800 for the 9 months youre in cu that breaks down to 1644 every month you can get a nice apartment in champaign and eat well for that amount of money personally i spend around 600 on rent 50 on utilities and maybe 500 on food each month since i eat out a lot which is only 1150 so how the geo claims that 16k is not enough for 1 person to live on for 9 months is beyond me the other 3 months of the year can be spent on an internship or at another job to make money 2 500 fees are too much ok nobody likes fees but undergrads pay fees out the ass saying 500 is an undue financial burden a page after asking for a raise seems silly 3 health insurance not an expert on health insurance but according to the attached document uiuc already pays at least 80 of the cost and the geo wants 87 the geo says that their premium went up 24 last year which i concede is a significant increase so perhaps this needs addressing but health insurance has been increasing over the entire us in the recent and notsorecent past so its more like a jump that is being passed though instead of absorbed by the administration which i can understand also its unreasonable to expect coverage for dependents grad students are students not full time workers so the benefits they receive should be scaled back accordingly you cant raise a family and go to grad school unless you have a lot saved up its just not a thing that the school can prudently support 4 child care shouldnt be a benefit the university provides if you have kids you should be working full time to provide for yourselfthem its unreasonable to say that you only want to work 20 hours a week 9 months of the year and raise kids on that salary and basically have the university foot the rest of the bill 5 contract duration i dont blame the administration for wanting a 5 year contract given the mess of the current strike and protests 6 tuition waivers this is a fairly complex subject and that i am by no means an expert at but i will take a stab anyway just to start i believe that tuition waivers are extremely important and extremely useful and i think some of the things the geo proposed in this category are beneficial i think that once waivers are awarded the terms should be fixed for the duration of the award 5 year for phd 2 for masters i think that it should be possible to switch between types of appointments ta ra etc and have a guarantee that your tuition waiver will still be valid as long as you have an appointment every semester and perform your duties finally i have absolutely no idea how the waivers are funded but i think funding for tas should come from the department and funding for ras should come from the corresponding grant the administration could also designate some money each year as a baseline to keep departments alive which dont get much grant money just my two cents if you disagree feel free to comment but in general i think the geo is throwing a big fat tantrum over mostly a bunch of nonissues edit for some reason all the numbers are showing up as 1 viewing normally but they are sequential as i wanted in edit view

2021-12-16 23:46:09,https://redd.it/riad17,8,anyone else just a little uncomfortable with the extremity of the backlash to the isg stuff,hello all first off i agree that isg leaderships message was illadvised and an abuse of power given the position they hold they should definitely have allowed for a coolingoff period and then tried to reestablish friendly relations failing that they could have gone through oscr or some other mediation process rather than scorching the earth and doxxing people certainly if a majority of students feel that this warrants impeachment or some other official sanction i would not object with that said the tone on here has gotten pretty reactionary i think the tendency of social media and this subreddit in particular to jump on bandwagons is contributing to this bear in mind that we dont necessarily know the full story there could have been other things going on besides that one groupme thread my bigger concern though is that this will snowball into a longterm kneecapping of isg which i dont think would be good as someone in the original posts comments said this debacle has probably set back the goal of divestment from fossil fuels significantly which im not happy about ultimately we all lose if we weaken our representatives many of the vote for me for isg president posts are funny but i think whoever replaces the current officers if necessary should be someone with a genuine passion for the position and the skills to accomplish their goals i worry that the next president might hesitate to take any controversial but perhaps necessary action for fear of a backlash like this lastly i want to speak on the issue of compensation for isg officers the positions are paid because they require a lot of time and many students here need to work to afford school if they were not paid it would preclude all but students wealthy enough to sacrifice significant amounts of time without pay to this job if isg leadership wants to vote itself a pay increase then before dismissing it outofhand we should consider whether its warranted we all know that inflation is high right now when was the last time isg received a costofliving adjustment if any this whole thing reminds me somewhat of the situation with us congressional salaries congress is entitled to colas like all other federal employees but they have routinely declinedhttpsfasorgsgpcrsmisc971011pdf them since 2009 while its easy to see this as and exercise of moderation and frugality it is in my opinion a way for wealthy congresspeople which is most of congress to score brownie points for not raising their own salaries while harming their lesswelloff colleagues in the long term much like rick scotts nauseating effort to eliminate congressional pensionshttpswwwmsnbccomrachelmaddowshowrickscottsnewreformmeasurecomesunintendedconsequencemsna1194391 a few years ago ps im aware of the difference between the isg leadership and the senate i dont disagree that reform might be necessary but my point here is just that the tone has gotten a bit bloodthirsty in my opinion

2018-03-05 23:00:18,https://redd.it/82cjbu,0,enough is enough,im just gonna preface this with the fact that i grew up in a union family and am fiercely prolabor i was supportive of the strike since the rumors first started making the rounds i went out of my way to avoid crossing picket lines i offered encouragement to picketers as they circled demanding their fair contracts i thought that this whole mess would be over after a few days when my father went on strike the union met with a mediator nightly each side made concessions and after a few days they came to an agreement i just figured the same would happen here i was dead wrong this strike is a travesty it is clear that for all their talk it is geo that is negotiating in bad faith typically if you want higher wages and better insurance and extraneous benefits waivers child care etc you pick 2 or 3 things to focus on not geo they arent content until they get everything they want thats not a strike thats holding the university hostage i hear rumors that certain departments are going to scab pretty soon do you know how pathetic that is if your own members are scabbing youve pushed your strike too far youve failed as a union and whats with these undergrads you keep marching out ive been part of several rallies in my life but never have i been expected to take to the picket line in the place of an actual worker and the icing on the cake is the disruption to undergrads my father toiled for years in scorching steel mills to help me attend this university with as little in the way of loans as possible because he worked blue collar i get to work white collar but this infernal racket is preventing me and my fellow students from carrying out our educations my fathers strikes could be loud and visible but never to this extent its a travesty these tas dont care about getting back to class nor do they care about their students what they want is to milk the absolute most ideal contract out of the university enough is enough stop the madness

2021-02-15 16:52:45,https://redd.it/lkpffe,1,a few words of advice from a former member of one of the disciplinary committees,tldr please do not contact the members of the senate committee on student discipline scsd and its subcommittees i believe that doing so would be an unhelpful and improper course of action as it may be seen as an attempt to undermine the impartiality of these disciplinary bodies remember these individuals are sacrificing their own time and effort to serve the interests of the university and its community without any compensation for doing so please be understanding of the fact that while they wield significant powers they are bound by the university‚Äôs policies and procedures in how they can exercise them lastly kindly crosscheck anything i‚Äôve stated against the links in this post ‚Äì i might have missed somethingmisspoke at some point and most of this information is freely available if you can find it i strongly urge you to read any and all relevant policies hello ruiuc i wasn‚Äôt planning on commenting regarding the recent events surrounding oscr and its policies but this posthttpswwwredditcomruiuccommentslkds7uivorchencasedisciplinarycommitteepanel has caused me a great deal of concern in short all members of the senate committee on student discipline scsd and its various subcommittees are explicitly instructed not to publicly comment on any of their cases ‚Äì either past or ongoing ‚Äì due to the implications regarding student privacy and impartiality in their decisionmaking process as such it is highly unlikely that any of you will receive a reply to your enquiries from any members of these committees furthermore while i acknowledge and appreciate that the op and various commenters have called for courtesy in the linked post i still believe that it is unhelpful and improper to contact the faculty and students especially the students who compose the scsd and its subcommittees these individuals are meant to be impartial in their adjudication of disciplinary cases that come before them they do not have the luxury of contemplating the optics of a case and its outcome during deliberations as they are bound to hew very closely with the student code and oscr policies in their decisions therefore any enquiries or petitions directed to the members of these committees are unlikely to looked upon favourably much less result in a response now i realise that this post may seem deeply unsatisfactory to a lot of you as the circumstances of the case in question do lend a great deal of sympathy to the student in question i‚Äôve been on panels that have dispensed similarly serious sanctions to students who have had sympathetic circumstances ‚Äì not because we necessarily wanted to ‚Äúthrow the book‚Äù at them quite the opposite in fact but rather because we were obliged by the student code and oscr policies to assign such sanctions that being said if you have the spare time and wish to make some genuine

2023-11-11 01:57:26,https://redd.it/17spt8s,0,why are uofi studentsgrads‚Ä¶ kinda weird,disclaimer this is a very long post so please read accordingly i don‚Äôt mean for this to be disrespectful in the slightest it‚Äôs just something i‚Äôve noticed i‚Äôm not generalizing all uofi kids just pointing something out‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm saying all of the below with love and kindness i have no intention of hating on uofi kids you guys are all special people and i personally apologize in advance if anyone is offended with that being said‚Ä¶ so i‚Äôve had friends in high school who went to uofi come back with complete different personalities and i know it‚Äôs not the typical ‚Äúeveryone grows and develops a different personality after college‚Äù or ‚Äúnot everyone‚Äôs path is the same‚Äù because i‚Äôve had friends that went to northwestern loyola uic wisconsin marquette ucla uhouston fsu and niu and they‚Äôve all been relatively the same personality wise obviously they‚Äôve all had their own individual paths but the overall personality and character is not much different than how were in high school some have become more mature well spoken physically built much better dressed etc but they‚Äôre still chill still their goofy selves and relatively how i expected them to be but my friends that went to uofi and new people i‚Äôve met that also went to uofi are entirely different i‚Äôll do my best to describe it but they‚Äôve just become suddenly sooo type a like everything is a challenge to them all of a sudden easily triggered have odd niche interests they‚Äôre not a fan of change and any slight inconvenience to their normal daily routine and they completely become unrecognizable almost borderline bipolar as talking to them is like walking on eggshells as in they start getting agitated and very passive aggressive this is just 67 of my friends that went to uofi so one can argue the sample size is small however i don‚Äôt think it is then there‚Äôs a couple of my coworkers both 37 and 42 respectively in my office they‚Äôre known as the ‚Äúannoyances‚Äù because it seems like everything annoys them and they annoy us about the things that annoy them this thought of uofi kids being weirdodd came to me just a couple weeks ago and the personality traits i‚Äôve noticed are shockingly similar to my coworkers i ask them the other day where they went to college not knowing where they went to to my surprise not really though they both are graduates of uofi this made me lose my mind in satisfaction because at this point it wasn‚Äôt even a coincidence anymore or me ‚Äúprojecting‚Äù what really solidified this hunch was both of my previous exes both were real type a and were always sooo passive aggressive they had little niche hobbies and if anything got in the way of those they‚Äôd flip out and not be able to contain themselves they both set insane boundaries that weren‚Äôt fair because when i‚Äôd set similar boundaries i become the bad guy or ‚Äútoo prude‚Äù i also noticed another common denominator between these uofi studentsgrads and that‚Äôs that they‚Äôre just not good in social settings they‚Äôre just totally socially inept like they can‚Äôt read social cues or have respect for people near them examples my friends from high school who went to uofi now make fun of what someone is wearing who is standing right next to them and suggests to me how they should fix it while that stranger can clearly hear them my uofi alumni coworkers mumble during a meeting to others near them about how poorly management operates name dropping them and makes wild assumptions as to why they operate so poorly‚Ä¶ while those management memebers are in the meeting with us my 2 ex gfs would be so obnoxiously loud one of them started singing opera in an intimate restaurant simply because she told me she likes it i didn‚Äôt cue her in or anything it was so embarrassing the other ex would yell ‚Äúno‚Äù like a child when i kindly offered to pay for her funnel cake at six flags it‚Äôs just all these different but consistently weird traits i‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs just so perplexing to me that the common denominator is that they‚Äôre all current or former uofi students it‚Äôs as if they all have this peculiar type a personality that‚Äôs just sooo obnoxious‚Ä¶ where if what they say doesn‚Äôt go their way they get real passive aggressive and aggravated again i‚Äôm not generalizing all uofi kids when i said the above and sorry if i offended any of you it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs far too large of a sample size for me to completely be oblivious to something that uofi kids specifically are exposed to i‚Äôve heard the saying that uofi kids have ‚Äúmain character syndrome‚Äù but that‚Äôs completely false because the main character isn‚Äôt a jerk or weird the main character is someone who is universally liked and being rooted for by the audience there‚Äôs no way any sane audience member would root for these uofi kids and their odd personalities i‚Äôm seeing honest genuine answers and insights preferably from someone who even remotely agrees or noticed what i‚Äôve noticed thank you tldr i‚Äôve noticed uofi studentsalumni are

2014-11-21 16:35:11,https://redd.it/2n12kg,0,proposal to fire tim beckman and use funds instead on illinoisnet,story i wrote a yak today about cancelling the football program to improve illinoisnet and someone in the comments suggested to fire tim beckman instead to fund it that suggestion is much more sound than my original one and i think this proposal might actually be achievable i think i might go pretty serious with this proposal so i started by sending this email to the faculty members of the athletic board ill see if i can find other ways to push this thing here it is title a sensible proposal to the members of the athletic board dear members of the athletic board the members i can find contact information for i am informing all of you that i actively will push for an administrative change with full effort beginning today that will affect the current state of athletic affairs at the university any proponents of my historical proposition will undoubtedly receive universal praise by students faculty alumni and media preface the illini football program is undeniably in a woeful state where the oppositions it can consistently defeat are the likes of institutions at the level of north memorial steak sauce university or eastern spaghetti institute of fashion occasionally illini football may be able to defeat teams such as minnesota but for those of you who are well versed in statistics and illini football records these victories are outliers and are therefore insignificant and irrelevant to some extent in order to improve the status quo of illini football massive financial investments will be required to enhance the current football infrastructure along with other major components of the program by seeing the progression of the football team in the past decade however it is clear that the university does not deem the football program as a priority at all it seems the only visible signs of a desire to change is through the replacement of the head coach in which mr ron zook was replaced by our current coach mr tim beckman on an annual compensation of a whopping 16 million seeing that a coach replacement upon the dismissal of mr zook has not changed the state of events it can be assumed that the dire state of illini football is not solely at fault of the coach but an organizational systemic ineptitude from scouting technical training to various levels that are associated with team coordination to correct these issues it will most certainly require great financial costs at the expense of other areas of budgeting such as academics returning to the previous assumption that illini football is systemically inadequate the hypothetical commissioning of the legendary chuck noll or even barney the dinosaur at this very moment would have limited impact on performance of illini football as a whole where the total overhaul of the illini football system is the only way of improving the program it would prove to be a costly project furthermore if the administration deemed football as a priority at all such changes would have already been made years ago under the justifiable and observable assumption that illini football will continue to produce underwhelming results unless major investments are made which would have already been done long ago if illini football is seen to hold any importance to the university i will make the following proposition proposition i propose the immediate dismissal of tim beckman and for a replacement coach the university will either promote someone from the existing coaching staff or to recruit a lesser regarded coach from another institution for this plan to work the replacement coach must accept an annual salary of less than 300000 given that a change of the head coach will have no little or no impact on the current state of illini football as reasoned in the preface the funds saved from the reduced costs in salary compensation can be reinvested into campus infrastructure that will generate great academic productivity which indirectly translates to more economic utility the replacement coach will receive 300000 as an annual compensation on a 5 year contract despite a lesser replacement the current profit margins mostly from television deals of illini football will likely remain the same given that the program still reports profits even after extremely poor performances it simply cannot get any worse the funds saved by this proposition should equate to more than 65 million over the course of 5 years the entirety of the 65 million will be diverted to address the immediate needs of the severely and disgracefully underfunded campus networking system ie wifi which includes network hardware infrastructure upgrades maintenance and so forth the state of campus networks is operating at a level that is beyond shameful for a reputable academic institution it is a universally accepted truth that campus networks are operating at a bronzeage level stable connection to the internet is an integral part of academic productivity being an academic institution there seems to be no reason to overfund a woeful nonacademic program illini football when a piece of crucial academic infrastructure is underfunded unreliable and unstable the relative economic yield from improved connections will more than likely surpass any damage under the assumption that the illini football team will perform poorly regardless of any change due to systemic failure which would be done by replacing mr beckman with a less regarded head coach on a 300000 annual compensation package seeing that professor ulen is very knowledge in economics i would like to see his assessment on this comparison to put it simply it is assumed that the university will produce more economic yield by upgrading the campus networking system than to hire a football coach even if such coach on the level of chuck noll such proposal should see the university to use funds in a much more rewarding way given that our football program will continue to have poor results regardless of who we hire this symbolic change will not only show a positive reaction from the university for immediate needs of its community but also will show the level of commitment the university administration is willing to make on the sound utilization of university funds and also a capability of making sensible administrative decisions beginning today i will commit myself fully by engaging in more student discourse and will also approach members of the student senate on the possibility of a student referendum i am also humbly asking for your support for this practical plan which is spawned from a reaction to the status quo of illini football and also the numerous problems and hindrances to academic progress that is associated with rubbish campus networking thank you for your time but really if you publicly endorse this proposal you will be eternally loved by all members of the illinois community sincerely op

2022-07-30 21:38:30,https://redd.it/wce4c6,1,no freshman information scienceisds is not a good major,over the past 4 or so months there have been like a million questions about information science on this sub most negative some positive so i am going to make my stance clear on it as someone who was an is major now stats with cs minor this post is so long i am going to divide it into multiple parts 1 careers from the ischool expectation vs reality so let me start with something that most of you would probably agree with me on the ischool really pushes their agenda that the is and isds majors prepare you for a career in data science is it true technically yes but what roles specifically data analyst roles which dont really require a great deal of depth in ds youre damn right these relatively low paying roles can be occupied by someone with a high school diploma and very basic python and excel knowledge this is not something you pay nearly 40k a year for in state price the major opens up 0 doors in anything cs or ds related and what is left is business analyst or uiux roles but hold up did you see the companies we had faang interns and people working at jp morgan but why on a 78k starting salary oh maybe its because the positions that the major opens up are some of the lowest paying technical roles out there a 78000 starting salary is one of the highest on campus sounds cool right well wait till you see where is graduates start working bay area seattle chicago nyc area only some of the most expensive areas to live on earth yes you can make the argument that most technical majors will have a majority of students moving there post graduation but they are compensated accordingly compared to that 2 the coursework compared to other technical majors that open the same doors there are cheaper majors at uiuc that go into much more depth in ds than the is or even isds coursework for example statistics my double major requires you to take probability 2x modeling 2x intro python and 4 technical electives that enforce a grounding of ds through coursework that is already based on calc i iii and linear what does is or isds have in comparison to this calc i linear algebra modeling for ds 300 lvl cs class intro python and algos for ds cs277 they took some of the most difficult classes at uiuc and created easier versions of them to accommodate the xds majors im sure this is fair to this paying more tuition to do it instead of stats or math 3 should i apply to cscsx or information science unless you are trying to do uiux design for the foreseeable future there is 0 reason for why you should pick information science over cs cs basically does everything that is does but at a more technical level in 1 year of instruction i read a comment on a recent is related post that said you learn more in 1 year of cs than you do in is and quite honestly it was spot on people say the is degree combines people and technology but i fail to understand how that is a skill that cannot be learned through experience or at worst outside the classroom on your own the is and isds majors are cluttered with ethics classes that do little good for the students trying to get jobs after it how how about the coursework the cs core is made up of 124128173222225233241357361374 and 421 you are also required to take up to calc 3 depending on the cs along with a math257 requirement this level of rigor is something that will actually get you ready for jobs in cs and ds and you get 400 lvl cs class registration priority as a cherry on the cupcake you can take classes such as data mining and machine learning to really add something valuable and something that requires skill to your knowledge base 4 i know i offended some people so i guess this is a personal opinion and a pretty strong one which i think can be backed up the is and isds majors have significant flaws and it exposes a severe gap between the expectations and realities of doors it will open following graduation i am not saying that is is a terrible major for everyone in fact it might be a cool and easier thing to do if you want to do uiux or want to get by doing more humanities work while still having a slight stem background understand that the title was just clickbait

2024-02-13 16:13:09,https://redd.it/1aq66il,4,regarding to the cnykny confrontation in the recent subreddit,i wasnt planning on starting a thread like this but with all the increased hatred towards chinese students in general i feel compelled write something about it first thing to admit the cssa did a shit job with the joint letter they overlooked the fact that many southeast asian countries have traces of chinese culture for instance both the japanese and koreans use kanji hanzi in official documents and formal writing of their names the lack of awareness assuming that koreans dont use hanzi and putting up red lanterns is just baffling i doubt theyve had much interaction with people from other southeast asian countries the spring festival is a significant celebration in every southeast asian nation‚Äîchinese japanese koreans and vietnamese all partake in the festivities even if we consider the joint letter as somewhat reasonable the subsequent post about koreansmas to christmas is one of the worst analogies ive come across in my life its reminiscent of how the cpc propagates ideas‚Äîonly the chinese get it while the rest of the world is left scratching their heads what disappointed me and most of the chinese the most was the characterization of korean before the lunar new year i understand that a large public school like u of i has students from various southeast asian nations however labeling something as korean doesnt sit well with me because practically every aspect of that booth showcasing the kny was basically identical to what youd see during cny and its worth noticing that china recently holds a negative stereotype of korea as a stealing nation ÂÅ∑ÂõΩ because korea once claimed confucius was korean im guessing thats what seethed the cssa up the spring festival is the most important festival for every southeast asian nations china korea regardless of north and south japan and vietnam all celebrate it nationwide but the thing that made the prefix korea especially uncomfortable to chinese is probably due to some historical issues korea has been a dependent territory of chinese dynasties for more than 1000 years and its no exaggeration saying that the root of korean culture came from ancient china before hunminjeongeum ÌõàÎØºÏ†ïÏùå korea did not have its own language and was using hanzi in documenting so the subtleness on kny is that this is supposedly a festival from china and yet koreans were using chinese symbols and tagged them as a part of their culture without the prefix korean i believe that such controversy would never even occur personally saying i do not agree with the name chinese new year or spring festival although it is how the authorities defined the festival i would call it chunjie simply using pinyin showing its trait as chinese without abiding to any other languages

2018-08-09 21:42:25,https://redd.it/96334r,7,concerned with oversaturationdumbing down of cs with csx expansion,uiuc is known as a toptier cs school by both students and employers alike in the past few years we have seen the obvious consequence of our success in adding new csx programs to further carve a niche and differentiate ourselves from the competition college has become big business and with toptier universities in neighboring states clamoring for our students along with a never ending budget crunch from springfield i am sure the cs dept feels compelled to act if it was not for or cs departments iterative approach to refining the curriculum and changing with the times we would have already stagnated and fell from our place as the fifth best school for cs however i fear we are rapidly progressing in the wrong direction and the bulk of this misfire is coming from the new csx programs my main complaints can be summed up as follows oversaturation and decreased academic rigor simply put the new csx programs do not seem to meet the high standard of a cs eng or mathcsstatscs degree looking at the course reqs cs advertising does not even require cs 241 one of if not the most important class a cs undergrad will take instead 233 and 241 are merged into an experimental cs240 i feel both 233 and 241 were very beneficial in my education and losing either would be a net negative one may argue that this is contained to a single major but i fear future reshuffling will make cs240 the norm for more csx programs csecon looks similar while 241 is thankfully required these new programs coming out this fall look like glorified cs minors with a chosen x attached in trying to prepare students in two fields i fear the student will leave unable to compete in either the other issue is over crowding which those of us in cs already know all too well with las transfer reqs as they exists now having all these new majors will have an adverse effect on all of us i have heard talk of changing csx from guaranteed transfer to holistic review for intracollegiate transfers a step in the right direction but as it stands it is obvious uiuc regards cs eng math cs and stats cs as the prestigious degrees while other csx are down a notch look at the las transfer requirements to see my point this discrepancy hurts the school and its ranking ultimately benefiting no one i feel the school is taking the wrong approach with its csx initiative i understand their desire to expand and stand out from the crowd but i would have to think specialized in field degrees would be the much smarted play not only for the school but the students a degree focused on a sub specialty of cs possibly with overlap in another field ie human interaction computation biology a dedicated information security degree would allow a student to find his path within the cs world while keeping the same core as the prestigious degrees instead these cs x programs are more or less stapling a cs minor onto an existing major i say this as the cs minor requirements are very similar to the cs requirements for cs econ and cs advertising in addition these majors do not require any additional cs electives to graduate this seems ridiculous to me why is there a new computational advertising class yet it is not required for cs advertising majors should such a class not be reserved foremost for them make classes that address areas at the intersection of x majors ie perhaps a ml class for trading or a hft class for cs econ but i digress note please understand that i am not trying to attack or demean the already existing cs x degrees i know that those in the x degrees currently really love what they do but i think that is self sorting and with this expansion we may see much less passionate people going into x areas

2022-11-14 13:25:50,https://redd.it/yv9s0w,79,physical appearance plays a huge role in your ability to socialize and make friends at college and im living proof of it,first a little background im an asianamerican male student who is currently a senior my first semester here was in the fall of 2019 and i was very excited to finally move off on my own meet new people and become involved with my peers despite having no real overt flaws that you hear about so much and are usually stereotypes levied against ece majors poor hygiene distasteful attire esoteric or strange hobbiesinterests i immediately became active in rsos and was very naturally extroverted toward my peers in my classes and in my dorm despite having the best intentions to meet people and make friends i started to notice that a lot of socialization is predicated on some initial interest which in most cases is usually material possessions or physical appearance even just listening to my peers have discussions or conversations just through regular observation i started to realize that most people only really ever talked about superficial things it became pretty clear that most of what people consider to be personality was really just an associated characterization of their physical appearance i figured out that this was a known phenomenon in psychology known as the halo effect i would just regularly hear women on campus talking with other women about how they were in toxic relationships or how they were willing to continue putting up with a guy that was unfaithful or abusive simply because of his appearance this is all that i ever really heard and have yet to really hear of any instances of someone truly being with someone for their actual character or their personality despite being in several clubs and being very extroverted having plenty of hobbiesinterests i was left with no real friends after my first semester here then came spring 2020 during the time of covid i started to notice just how much physical appearance really mattered when it came to socializing and making friends on campus i had the chance to actually listen to and be around guys that were very socially successful and had large social circles and i quickly learned that many of them had personalities that were actually the opposite of what youd expect from people that had a lot of friends or were very romantically successful many of them were obsessed with vanity their wealth and other immutable traits like height i had to listen to one of my neighbors constantly mention that he is 64 in great shape and majoring in finance like none of that is really a personality but i noticed that in most cases this is actually how people describe each other they might come up with characterizations or personality traits for someone but its always based first on what that person looks like almost never on how that person actually acts or behaves this isnt a story about how i noticed all of these things and did nothing about it but instead that i was able to make an assessment of the realities of socializing and dating and make adjustments accordingly during the spring of 2020 and all of the summer i dedicated myself to working out 6 days a week and eating a perfect diet i also started to style my hair a lot like some of the guys that i noticed who were popular and seemed to constantly have social opportunities just fall into their laps coming back in the fall of 2021 i had someone take the initiative to talk to me in every one of my classes that semester i had people asking me for my socials my snap and inviting me to groups for the class without even saying anything to them this was something that had never happened to me before despite being very social and friendly when i stopped being social and just focused on myself and my appearance then suddenly all of the opportunities started to present themselves to me i was never unwashed or dirty i would never do anything rude or vile to people and i was always looking for friends and social connections but was met with nothing but disinterest and sometimes even open hostility ive since continued to work out regularly over the last few semesters and i can say that the results have only continued to come rolling in ive been randomly approached by girls on campus or at social gatherings and had them strike up conversations with me and even make romantic propositions nothing about my personality has changed but now people are suddenly interested in me and willing to date me or be my friend its not like i changed my personality or my approach to socializing during that time i am still very much the same person i was before but my external appearance has changed before no one seemed to care if we shared similar interests or hobbies and only saw me as some weird creep for wanting to talk to them about their interests now i have people showing genuine concern for me reaching out to me and regularly inviting me to parties and social events its obviously much better to be in the situation that im in now but i just cant help but sometimes feel really shitty about the reason why i was without friends and basically ostracized by my peers it hurts me to think about the other people that are in a similar situation currently and are struggling to make friends or meet people only to have people gaslight them and lie to them about the importance of physical appearance when it comes to socializing and dating ive genuinely put less effort into meeting people and talking to people and have only had greater returns in my social life since i started working out and putting extra effort into my looks before i was practically spinning my tires in the mud and wasnt getting anywhere no matter how much i tried to meet people and make friends i was regularly flaked on by people that i tried to fit in with or left on read by people when id invite them to hang out now i have so many opportunities and people in my social circle that i dont have enough time to spend with all of them while im not willing to go back to the way things were before id be willing to bet any amount of money that if my appearance reverted to the way that it was my freshman year all of my relationships and dating opportunities would vanish nearly instantly i dont really judge people solely based on the way that they look but i quickly realized that many of the students here do just that in order to fit in and play the game i had to play it by their rules

2023-12-04 23:36:53,https://redd.it/18b4y5t,0,i went through uiuc geos solidarity statements and press releases so you wont have to tldr the geo is antisemitic,i am an israeli grad student at uiuc and i recently became aware of a draft for a statement calling for a ceasefirehttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1kam8uhgxzjbyay347qx9juukndjue9r57orfdtakeditlinkid0canid172012f695ef0051d925503c61c7383csourceemailgeomeetingtoproduceceasefirestatementemailreferreremail2132842emailsubjectgeomeetingtoproduceceasefirestatementlinkattached being written by the geo i wondered why and how often does the geo concern itself with foreign affairs and read through most of uiuc geos solidarity statements and press releaseshttpswwwuiucgeoorgsolidaritystatementsandpressreleases i assume most of you already know where this is going their site contains 90 items dating as far back as early 2018 80 of which refer to purely domestic issues here in the us that includs press releases about contract negotiations with uiucs leadership and so forth and 10 involve foreign countries of the latter 1 supports workers in bangladesh attacked because of their attempt to unionize 1 supports the people of peru after their congress staged a legislative coup 1 supports students in pakistan amidst general neglection of the countrys highed system 1 supports the colombian people in their struggle against tax reforms so far so good but now things start getting interesting 1 statement is a solidarity statement with turkey lebanon and syria after a devastating earthquakehttpsenwikipediaorgwiki2023turkeye28093syriaearthquakes hit the region well not exactly about 75 of the statement is actually criticism against the sanctions on syria placed by the collective west their words they mention that these were placed because of a proxy war in the region but also that regardless of one‚Äôs position on the happenings in the syrian proxy war we should center humanity they seem to mean and remove the sanctions and add that the logic of sanctions is meant to put maximum pressure on the people starve them in order to make them revolt against the regime and support a new friendlier regime this is against the 1949 geneva convention that war is still ongoing btw we will come back to all of that later 1 statement is a condemnation of actions of the iranian regime against students during the last big wave of civil unrest in the countryhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimahsaaminiprotests the statement does specifically mention that the geo is opposed to calls to get rid of the totalitarian theocracy currently supporting several terrorist proxies in the middle east including in gaza lebanon yemen and syriahttpswwwnytimescom20231027worldmiddleeastiranproxymilitiashtml in their words we reject any statement that wants to usurp iranians‚Äô voice for a more dignified life free from oppression by forces of imperialism and zionism finally we got to israel who apparently is oppressing the iranian people side note please ask your iranian and iranianamerican friends about this the last 4 statements and apparently soon there will be another one deal with israel whats in them 2 are variants of statements in support of bds meaning the effort to boycott israeli companies and such divest money away from israel and place sanctions on isra wait what the geo that vehemently opposes the genevaconventionviolating placing of sanctions actually has 2 statements supporting sanctions well lets not forget the 3rd statement regarding israel where the geo supports a professor in umich that was facing pressure after participating in bds efforts and refused to write a recommendation letter to a student who wished to study in israel yes the geo supported sanctions and a professor who refused to write a recommendation letter btw a good few countries canada for onehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiantibdslaws and many many us stateshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiantibdslaws consider bds antisemitichttpsenwikipediaorgwikiantibdslaws the last statement involving israel is all about the difference according to the geo between antisemitism and antizionism imagine that the geo feels comfortable telling jews what is considered as antisemitism and what isnt dont hold your breath waiting for them to issue similar statements on islamophobia transphobia racism ableism or any other form of ism or phobia apparently if you are from the group facing the greatest number of hate crimes in the ushttpswwwjusticegovcrshighlights2022hatecrimestatistics proportional to population size and its been like that for a good number of years now doing that is just fine in conclusion the geo cares about foreign affairs when individuals students workers are fighting for rights from their governments when sanctions should be lifted from syria or when sanctions should be placed on israel well maybe israel is really special maybe israel is really this bad remember the sanctions on syria that the geo vehemently opposed how many people died in the entirety of the conflict in israel feel free to include soldiers from the 7 arab nations that attacked israel in the past 75 years and how many civilians did the forces of bashar alassad syrias tyrannical president kill since 2011 some of whom died horrible deaths by chemical warfare why support sanctions against israel but not against syria well maybe its because israel is committing genocide even the geo is careful when saying that at least in these statements less so in this geo antisemitic stshowhttpswwwredditcomruiuccomments17mzfc4geoextremelybiasedpanelthesituationof and they mostly talk about incremental genocide a term coined by israeli historian ilan pappe but lets not open this specific can of worms we can do that in the comments and instead look at this interesting list of genocides on wikipediahttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofgenocides notice that 3 of these are ongoing and have been for quite some time and another one was still happening in 2019 has the geo made any statements regarding these no well maybe its about the war not the genocide hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahalistofongoingwarshttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofongoingarmedconflictsahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahaukrainehahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha nations fighting for independencenopehttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistsofactiveseparatistmovements occupied landssorry nohttpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmilitaryoccupations maybe israel is just generally the worst country everworse than north korea so what is it about israel let‚Äôs not even discuss whether the geo should even take stands on foreign affairs which it obviously isn‚Äôt for the vast majority of them its just involved in a single specific one but why that one what is so special about it yeah the geo is antisemitic

students interests yesterday we a few israelis including students and community members went to a panel organized by the geo graduate employee organization that was labeled ‚Äúa panel to understand the historical roots of recent events in palestine and israel‚Äù we came to have a dialog with the panel as well as other students and community members who are interested in the topic the massacre of more than 1400 men women and children from israel as well as the kidnapping of more than 200 men women and children from israel that happened on october 7th has led all of us in the past few weeks that passed to experience daily trauma grief and desperation we personally know these victims this is not a theoretical argument for us we cried and mourned their deaths and the horrible state the families of the kidnapped are left in not knowing what is happening to their loved ones still we want to be a part of a discussion a part of a community that works towards change and hopes for peace this was the state of mind we had going to the geo event in the panel no one mentioned the massacre of october 7th no one mentioned the civilians who were kidnapped and held hostage i guess this is not a part of ‚Äúrecent events in palestine and israel‚Äù what was said assistant professor uiuc ‚Äúthis violence of hamas is not merely strategic in their war for liberation but its also a cleansing of oneself of anxieties of the occupation of exploitation‚Äù ‚Äúthe us and the israeli began to publicize hamas‚Äôs calls for truce and new borders for free palestine as antijewish movement essentially creating a new weaponized form of antisemitism to demonize anybody who calls for independence‚Äù ‚Äúthe armed resistance hamas should not be referred to in crude inhumane terms such as terrorists‚Äù ‚Äúthe us and the israeli began to publicize hamas‚Äôs calls for truce and new borders for free palestine as anti jewish movement essentially creating a new weaponized form of antisemitism to demonize anybody who calls for independence‚Äù ‚Äúthe state of israel proved their worth and the us swept in to israel like the vampire it is to extract as many resources as possible‚Äù ‚Äúwe need to dismantle the oppression and put the humanity back in the discussion‚Äù social justice for palestine ‚Äúhertzel chose palestine for various reasons all those reasons go back to antiarab rhetoric and bigotry‚Äù ‚Äúi hope you realize the evil that zionism is and that it has no place anywhere in the world‚Äù ‚Äúisrael has no interest in creating a safe haven for jews it only sees it for its financial gain as does america‚Äù ‚Äúwe must all become antizionists the world needs nothing short of that‚Äù phd candidate uiuc ‚Äúwhen we say ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù we are not talking about genocide or ethnic cleansing we are talking about the elimination of a dominating structure and the equal protection and the enjoinment of rights and privileges‚Äù adjunct assistant professor john jay college cuny labor for palestine ‚Äúin gaza the armed resistance refuses to submit to israel‚Äôs designs for ethnic cleansing‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs amazing how in their statements and resolutions and protests students are unapologetic about the palestinian national liberation by any means necessary‚Äù assistant professor virginia tech ‚Äúwe need to begin by strongly and loudly saying that currently israel is conducting a genocide in gaza‚Äù ‚Äúisrael demonstrated genocidal intent against the people of palestine‚Äù ‚Äúthere is a genocide happening and the palestinian armed resistance is fighting against this genocide‚Äù ‚Äúwe need to be very clear on one side we have a genocidal war on the other side we have armed resistance against genocide against colonization which is essentially a liberation war there are 2 wars right now ‚Äì the war of genocide and the war of liberation‚Äù ‚Äúas we formulate tactics and strategies to oppose this genocidal war its imperative that we do not throw the armed resistance under the bus in palestine‚Äù ‚Äúwe cannot play the game that the zionists are playing trying to distinguish between the so called humanitarian civilian space the political power of the armed resistance in palestine‚Äù ‚Äúwhat the armed resistance in palestine is challenging is the primal the fundamental equasion that underpins colonialism‚Äù ‚Äúi heard the first speaker speak about violence and the way it can be cathartic and a means to decolonize but there is also a much more direct purpose to armed resistance as it hits at the core at the heart of colonial power‚Äù ‚Äúfrom southern lebanon hizballa uses armed struggle to end the occupation from southern lebanon‚Äù ‚Äúit is imperative that we have clarity that the palestinian armed struggle is one that is in response israel‚Äôs genocide and taking palestinian prisoners that is the context of the violence it is not simply cathartic it is meant for the liberation of palestine to end imperialism this equation of force must be transformed‚Äù the moderator concluded saying that ‚Äúwe heard of the role of the armed resistance in fighting a war against genocide a war of liberation even that terminology is just extremely important i appreciated the analysis of the root causes of the problem and provided historical context of zionism i think was particularly important‚Äù when given the opportunity to ask questions we raised the ethnic cleansing of jews from arab countries that fled to israel as well as jews living in israel for generations we asked the panel to denounce hamas if the panel seeks a peaceful and equal solution as hamas denounces peace with jews we also asked what the panel thinks about the composition of the panel when discussing the situation in israel and palestine and the fact that it was extremely biased and one sided finally we asked why were the events of october 7th not mentioned the panel answered that jews were not cleansed from arab countries that it is propaganda to say so ‚Äúwhat happened on oct 7th did not happen in a vacuum it did not start any new war any new deaths palestinians have been relentlessly murdered and relentlessly bombed since 1948 and we should talk about what happened before october 7th the reason why hamas launched their reaction is because jewish settlers went and harassed muslim worshipers in their mosque in one of the holiest sites for muslims‚Äù when pressed on what happened on oct 7th‚Ä¶ ‚Äúon oct 7th hamas went and they made paragliders and they went and flew to where israelis were holding a concert a festival right next to gaza an open air prison and they took israeli settlers as political pieces for exchange for all the palestinian prisoners who are wrongfully imprisoned for no reason‚Äù they stopped the discussion when we asked how many were murdered and whether a 9 month old is a political prisoner they did not answer the questions about the composition of the panel and only referred to hamas in any way except as justified armed resistance

2017-10-28 01:34:08,https://redd.it/798pqq,0,i was involved in tonights antichief protest and want to be open about the context and what transpired,im a student senator who was involved in the creation of the resolution adopted this wednesday nighthttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1be66ysvqune2bvcfifiaaxheftcfstgxhfzfesvajqedit after hearing from native american constitutents who felt unwelcome on their home campus due to the continued chief imagery first and foremost its important to not invalidate the lived experiences of these fellow students while there may be native american students who support the chief it would be wrong to deem their luxuries more valuable than other students discomforts thus after adopting this resolution virtually unanimously in the senate i and others set out to organize a boycottturnedprotest of the parade and pull all official isg involvement from the event our cabinet members and other rsos came together to plan an excruciatingly wellthought out protest that was nonviolent and civil and i think it was a massive success on that front the biggest takeaway from this is that the administration chancellor and board of trustees are all rumored to be taking the issue of finding a new mascot more seriously after this weeks events that should be welcome news for everyone i guess this is sort of an invitation to ama i realize i have a unique insight into the process and i want to address any concerns or opposing viewpoints people might have about the protests and the subject matter i will be replying in my capacity as a student not as an official representative of the isg my views will be my own to share
2018-02-08 01:36:25,https://redd.it/7w37zr,0,its honestly atrocious how badly the ece majors at this school are treated,ive been on this sub for 2 years now i made this acc to keep my main anonymous and its honestly ridiculous how badly the ece majors at this school are treated like i shouldnt be thought of as less of a person just because i have a passion for plugging wires into computers for other majors its honestly fine if somebody makes a comment about humanities majors being bad or something it gets downvoted the shit out of but if somebody says anything trashy about ece majors it gets upvoted like crazy im tired of all this bullshit like ece majors never shower and shit like damn i shower every damn day people ask me sometimes what my major is and sometimes i lie that im in linguistics or something because i dont want to hear the scoff and sigh as they realise that im in ece like honestly people its 2018 we shouldnt discriminate based on major first off is this stupid hygiene thing i dont understand why people associate ece with bad hygiene or not taking a shower or some shit im a very hygienic person and i shower and brush my teeth like a normal fucking person but people are like hahaha youre in ece you must have never taken a shower in your entire life as if having a passion for circuitry makes you not want to take a shower or some shit if anything the cs majors should have this stereotype because they just sit at their computer all day not saying they should or anything just an example i think its atrocious that ece majors are put through this treatment while our building is one of the few department buildings to house its own showers like what the hell ever since i was young i have had a deep passion for circuitry and computing in general as my dad bought me a radio kit that i loved messing around with every night i started to build electronics and computers from a young age i even built a prosthetic hand from scratch and that was one of the proudest moments of my life to be honest my passion for electronics eventually inspired me to join the electrical engineering department at uiuc because it is one of the higher ranked in the nation but people here are so mean im also an indian male so i face some intersectionality in discrimination in that people assume im here because my parents forced me to and im some random shitty fuckboy that goes and gets wasted at some aio party every night i really do have a passion for ece and it honestly irks me that people think of me in this way its honestly ridiculous once i was standing outside siebel to work on an mp with a friend and i was locked out and some cs guy was walking past and i asked him to swipe me in to work and he walked over to swipe me in and he asked for my major and i said ece and he just left without saying another word i looked at his face and i could just see the disgust pouring out of his eyes this is unacceptable no major should face this level of discrimination on campus also people always say why are you in ece instead of being in cs when its just the same thing was cs too hard to get into or something this pisses me off to no end have people ever considered that its possible to have a passion for the circuitry and logic of how computers actually work something that cs majors mostly dont care about because all they care about is some shitty internship at facebooksnapchatinstagrametc ece majors are the ones who really care about the groundbreaking technology all cs majors care about it making the next big app adding more and more vapid crap to the app store that no one cares about but makes money exploiting peoples reward mechanisms and insecurities i picked this major because of my passion because i want to do something that actually has an effect on the world not just make some crappy app and people have the audacity to ask me why did you do ece because its easier to get into and you dont want to make money ugh another thing that riles me up is girls i honestly already wasnt great with talking to girls and being an ece major has made me 100 times worse everybody automatically assumes im socially inept completely incompetent hermit recluse that just sits in my room jerkin it to gay hentai or some shit i like hanging out with people and i like social interactions whenever i try to talk to girls immediately after i tell them my major they get this weird look in their eyes and start trying to get rid of me as fast as possible its honestly quite ridiculous and to be honest i like to talk to girls and im a relatively nice guy not like the nice guy stereotype or anything but girls immediately reject me because of my major other guys also give me a hard time because im in ece they think im some kinda virgin loser that has never even talked to a girl in my entire life even though i have no issues talking to girls it still isnt my fault that the lack of girls in the major that im passionate about makes people assume that i dont even know what a girl is or something picking the major that i was passionate about has resulted in a net negative for my sex life which is quite ridiculous in my opinion if youre reading this far thanks so much ill try to end on a positive note because i know that this stuff can get pretty depressing and heavy but im just saying you guys need to lighten up on ece majors in general maybe if you see one of us on campus instead of belittling us you can make someones day better by saying something like hi internationalbell32 i appreciate you as a person im sure wed all appreciate it a lot

2021-08-27 06:43:12,https://redd.it/pclnw5,0,open letter reply to religiousmedical exemptions vaccination massmail et al,good morning my friends i am an alum and i have just a few things to say regarding this generations handling of covid19 ill try not to say anything unverifiable or patently false i will not come out as for or against vaccination i dont usually post openly but im writing to you now because i hear some struggling and pain out there and i want to help bring the temperature down a bit we didnt have these things when i attended so for those of you just joining and those of you coming back for more im sorry you have been robbed of some very special time in your life through no fault of your own i got my 4 years maybe some of your college experience can be normal in the next couple years maybe not thats just the way the cookie crumbles and i wish that it werent because youll graduate join the workforce and well live happily ever after right i hope so many thanks to each one of you for conducting yourself in an exemplary way in these trying times we cant all be impeccable and perfect but i know everyone is doing their absolute best in what they believe is right even when not everyone agrees and in this country thats what has always gotten us through when we saw the planes hit the towers in nyc on television our hearts sank we knew we were in this together firefighters volunteered and flew to new york we donated our time and money and we raised our flags the enemy was out there this crisis pits neighbor against neighbor and it shouldnt were better than that and smarter than that i would encourage you to continue seeing your friends and neighbors as humans flawed imperfect and if you believe it endowed by their creator with his perfect likeness and the dignity to conduct their lives the way that they believe is a best reflection on that when it comes to a religious exemption if you believe in your heart of hearts that the vaccination is not for you i respect that and i respect you whether your particular religious denominations leaders agree with you or not whether you are formally a member of a particular religious institution or not it is your relationship with your creator and i must not pass judgment on you we may all have to answer for our decisions one day and neither i nor any other human institution doctrine or policy can give you any real assurance that you are right or wrong about that read the declaration of independence re inalienable rights if you have any doubt as to how this country is oriented towards the practice of faith of any kind i am not a doctor what follows is some common sense advice from having lived a little bit longer than many of you as for a medical exemption there are reactions to the vaccine some severe some not ive seen coworkers shivering and wrapping themselves in blankets after taking their second shot some say it lasts a day some longer we dont know why this happens only that it does if youre worried about this or something worse happening to you in the short term or the long term talk to your doctor if you are the sort of person who is sensitive to environmental factors dust mold previous medical conditions whatever talk to your doctor if you dont have a doctor who is your doctor get one find one who understands you doesnt rush you and spends time to listen to you without judgment or dismissal one who neither speaks condescendingly to you nor blows smoke up your ass real medicine is holistic your doctor may not be a psychologist but he should care about and be aware of your psychology your doctor may not be a dietitian but he should know your dietary habits and be able to counsel you on them in short he needs to care for you as individual human not a case number not another billable client not another instance to enforce protocol you are his patient what you say to him is confidential in every way select a doctor who is intelligent and employs his own intelligence to your specific case i spell this out because not everyone has been fortunate enough to have a doctor like this to clarify without intent to shitpost this was not my personal mckinley experience a number of years ago every drug and treatment in existence when advertised they all say to ask your doctor if it is right for you do so before you do or do not take the covid vaccination if you and your doctor decide to take the shot get the recommendation from him as to which one you take and when do not be rushed by false deadlines from massmails its still your body feel good about this decision because you made it with your doctor if you and your doctor decide not to take it feel good about that also and make sure your doctor writes you the exemption no bureaucrat is supposed to be able to argue with that in this country and no further explanation is necessary to uiuc staff your peers or anyone unless you choose to release your medical files if you need more time to meet with your doctor and to make an informed decision call your doctors office and request they write you a temporary exemption until such time as you are able to meet with your doctor to properly assess your individual case its my personal belief you shouldnt have to justify these things to anyone but some may feel the pressure more harshly than others and so gather justification from authority as needed thanks for reading this and thank you again for doing the best you can based on what you know and the information you have available to you thats all ive got to say for now take care be healthy and smile youre alive you exist you are still breathing

take but after reading that post from megan about wearing a mask and seeing some of the responses to it i thought it would be valuable to present a counterpoint of sorts and also share some statistics hopefully any discussion about this is civil and doesnt senselessly get downvoted to megan if she reads this i am incredibly sorry for all you have had to endure and i am genuinely happy that you were able to get through chemotherapy that is an insanely hard battle that not everyone can endure i understand your concerns with the new variant and the valid fears that come with being an immunocompromised individual however with all due respect the argument you presented doesnt really take a nuanced look at any of the datastatistics about the spread of the delta variant first of all it is worth looking into the basis of the cdc recommendation that recommendation cited a study done in india extremely low rate of vaccination analyzed the spread of the delta variant through a vaccine not approved for public distribution in the united states and the study did not pass peer review it is disingenuous to utilize such a study and create recommendations based on that especially a study done in a different country yet that is what was done a holistic view of the united states data paints a very different picture x200b source our world in datahttpspreviewreddit07jzb3x9dme71jpgwidth828formatpjpgautowebpsbc285f6d3a311bfb6b6511ea4019c9bf7cc86059 as seen in the graph above the number of cases has unquestionably gone up but the number of deaths has stayed flat despite the delta variant being the most prevalent strain currently in circulation it is also worth noting that the department of health and human services states that 50 to 129 million 19 to 50 percent of nonelderly americans have some type of preexisting health condition source cmsgovhttpscmsgov despite that the curve of deaths from covid19 has been completely flattened and has stayed that way even with the introduction of the delta variant in may why is that its because individuals who fall under that category are almost all vaccinated tldr vaccines work next it is important to consider location yes cases have risen in the united states as a whole as expected from this variant but 5 minutes of research would show that certain areas disproportionately contribute to the rise of cases more than others source new york timeshttpspreviewredditvw9bac7wule71jpgwidth1272formatpjpgautowebpsce2a9eabbf3c0cf7bc61a3f34d12b04fcad66ce5 the cdc director dr rochelle walensky has also stated that the risk of getting symptomatic infection when exposed to the delta variant was reduced sevenfold when someone was fully vaccinated and she said there was a twentyfold reduction for hospitalizations and deaths champaign county has one of the higher vaccination rates amongst counties in the united states with 633 of the eligible population vaccinated source covidactnoworghttpscovidactnoworg and champaignurbana public health district and this percentage is likely much higher given that many of the student body received vaccines outside of champaign common scientific principles assume herd immunity above 70 vaccination rate and we are very close to if not already at that threshold these facts beg the question why are we treating uiuc the same way that we would treat a place with low rates of vaccination the cdc recommendations are exactly that recommendations it is up to us to use logic and data to dictate how we want to move forward based on the covid situation we are experiencing not the covid situation some random county in arkansas is experiencing this student body has been incredibly resilient and accommodating of testing schedules dealing with a monthslong shutdown of places we know and love and have been forced to go through a virtual educational experience for over a year learning some of the hardest subjects in the world our teachers have had to put their research on hold deliver instruction to blank screens on zoom or best case a sprinkling of students in a lecture hall all faceless behind masks the vast majority of our campus community has been vaccinated under the hope and promise that they were doing the right thing and they could finally experience a normal school year again at the university of illinois and our school administration was fully on board until a few days ago so what changed politics under the fear of scrutiny and criticism the uiuc administration seemingly ignored all data that would suggest delta variant or not we had the systems in place both an overwhelming majority of the campus population vaccinated as well as the consistent testing structure to ensure that we would be fine the problem for many isnt even the mask mandate it is the implications that this decision brings if with little to no justification to change our course of action the university is this easily able to succumb to cdc recommendations that werent even relevant to us then whos to say that at the slightest fluctuation in data we dont find ourselves in another semester of online instruction x200b for 15 months our lives were put in turmoil we followed frantic regulations and adapted to new circumstances in hopes of surviving the pandemic every time the end was in sight suddenly it was pushed back further for a vast majority of us the thing that we became sick of through the pandemic was that our existence consisted of just surviving the science says its time we started living again the politics say we have more to go the choice is yours

2014-04-03 17:06:14,https://redd.it/2252z1,0,saw this on facebook today a native american uiuc students account of his experience on campus,i thought this was worth sharing here it is copied and pasted my name is xochitl sandoval i am an indigenous student here at uiuc i write this to you as a condensed statement and explanation of my experience as a student at the university of illinois at urbana champaign i hope it finds you in a good way and is met with a receptive spirit what i write to you is very personal and very sacred because it is about my life and the legacy of disrespect and racism towards myself and the indigenous people who lived on this land and who continue to bear the unbelievable burden of having to fight for respect this letter is not only for you but it is also a statement that i intend on circulating to as many places and people as possible so if some parts are written in a way that is not meant directly for you it is because they are for the larger audience on march 11 i had the thought that i should commit suicide on march 11 2014 i specifically thought ‚Äúblow your brains out on the quad‚Äù my process was as follows write a letter to mr jamie and explain that this whole chief situation was so unbearable and the apathy on behalf of administration so painful that it was obvious that nothing was going to change maybe suicide was the way i would then purchase a gun load it go onto the quad stand facing union bring the gun up to my temple and pull the trigger maybe by committing suicide you chancellor phyllis wise the board of trustees and the university of illinois at urbana champaign administration will realize that no i am not exaggerating about the emotional physical and spiritual pain that seeing the formeryetstilllingering chief mascot has on me on march 3 2014 i wrote an email to my spanish professor expressing my concerns as a student in her class one student had been wearing sweatshirts with the name ‚Äòchief‚Äô on them and a second came with a sweater that had the image on it in this email i articulated to her that as a student i had rights that had been outlined by the university that ensured every student would have ‚Äúfreedom to learn free and open expression with limits that do not interfere with the rights of others respect for the dignity of others and personal and institutional openness to constructive change‚Äù i explained to her that as an indigenous student this image and every likeness to it represented a complete disregard for american indian culture and spiritual practices and that every time i saw it it was not only an emotional stab but also an impediment to my academic success in the student handbook in section 1302 rules of conduct number 5 states that ‚Äúengaging in behavior which is so persistent pervasive or severe as to deny a person‚Äôs ability to participate in the university community‚Äù is grounds for discipline which every likeness to the chief is to me additionally the university‚Äôs office of diversity equity and access outlines in campus climate section 2 ‚Äúhostile environments‚Äù states that a hostile environment which is prohibited by university policy consists of but is not limited to ‚Äúunreasonably interfering with an individuals work or academic performance by creating an objectively intimidating hostile or offensive work or learning environment‚Äù which the image and the people who continue to use the image have created for me upon emailing this letter to her i went to see the dean of students to create a formal complaint the dean referred me to the office of diversity equity and access to meet with an attorney to further discuss this situation i met with the attorney on march 11 after which while walking across the quad on my way to the native american house i watched myself purchase a gun and commit suicide on the quad the attorney told me that the only two options that were available to me were to either mediate a conversation with the students who were using the chief name and logo or to give a presentation to my class without mentioning my complaint about how this mascot was offensive to some american indian people to the first i was appalled i did not understand the logic in having to confront the people who were the ones hurting me and so i said no to the second i stated that if she had a responsibility to take action to go ahead but for me it would not be a solution a presentation is something i can and have done i was not and am not looking to settle for a bandaid solution to this problem that has caused such an immense psychological damage to not only myself but countless others i along with countless others have had to endure the unbelievable and unjust burden of educating a racist image so deeply imbedded in the psyche of this campus as i look through the campus spirit revival facebook page i feel the nauseating anger take hold of me again people such as bryce dirks attacked us in such ignorant hateful and hostile ways that now i remember why i do not feel part of this campus i remember now why i am not going to commencement i am reminded again that i am defenseless because the people who have the legal obligation to protect me as a student are turning their backs and allowing these people to degrade us over and over again i am reminded why i do not feel safe on campus i am reminded that i regret having come to this university and that i would not encourage any minority student to come to this campus granted there were many professors and tas who were very encouraging and supportive during this time there was also the native american house which from the beginning was my place of refuge however a place of refuge is not enough i knew that there was somewhere i could run to but that eventually i would need to leave that place and confront the massive student body that continue to display chief hats pins shirts sweaters stickers and etc i am going to backtrack a little in order to discuss campus spirit revival csr as you surely must have heard of is a student organization which was founded by tom and which i became the president of when he graduated it was created in order to find a new symbol for the university being that since the chief was retired we do not have one a contest was held for students to submit their ideas but this proved to be a difficult process since prochief people became very aggressive towards us stating that they wanted a ‚Äòno change‚Äô option which ultimately led to the results being withheld in moot court given that it seemed as if students did not yet understand why the chief had been retired in the first place and did not seem open to dialogue through facebook csr decided to collaborate with the native american and indigenous student organization to host a forum called ‚Äòtradition or transition a forum on chief illiniwek‚Äô on april 16 2013 we attempted to contact the honor the chief society students for chief illiniwek stop campus spirit revival in order to work with them our thought was that facebook discussions were turning very negative and no real progress was being made additionally being online made things very impersonal so perhaps face to face dialogue would be better we contacted honor the chief society students for chief illiniwek and stop campus spirit revival members none of whom wanted to collaborate with us josh good a graduate of uiuc and an administrator of the scsr facebook page after my repeatedly telling him that we wanted to work together to format this event as was best possible told me that he was not interested in a ‚Äúmassive circus‚Äù or public debate although debate had already been raging online he also said that with 1900 people it is hard to control the extremists well here the university could have stepped up in defense of we the students who were being attacked through our csr facebook page people such as eric arno hiller called us traitors to the university as well as tyrants timothy thilmony called us uninformed people who were just looking for a cause john tuttle called our organization an ‚Äúembarrassing display of buffoonery at the ui‚Äù ben cheslow kraatz said we were ‚Äúpopularityseeking incredibly unintelligent people‚Äù i along with others withstood all of this without any support from the university more recently i was told i was acting like a ‚Äúpersonally wounded party and like a child‚Äù and that my militant attitude towards the chief issue was not the way to address this issue and that prochief people needed time to heal again discrediting my emotions in a way that i have unfortunately become all too familiar with through interactions with the university the forum itself was interesting to say the least ivan dozier jr the ‚Äúchief himself‚Äù did show up he did not help create the event he never replied to my message and he did not let csr know ahead of time he would be there the only reason we knew to expect him was through a friend another csr member and i presented powerpoints we had created for the event after which we opened up the dialogue he presented himself as the person who does the unofficial chief portrayal a member of the native american house the president of students for chief illiniwek and the student liaison of the honor the chief society although he did not come representing any of those groups and i in two years have never seen him at the native american house dozier stated that the dance and regalia were not authentic and that he found solace in that i‚Äôm not sure if all of the chief supporters are aware of that but thankfully at least he is he stated the psychology study on the effects of native mascots on people was wrong he stated that it is not possible to find something that offends no one and told us this heartfelt story of his childhood ‚Äúwhen i was little i had a harrowing experience with animal crackers because i couldn‚Äôt decide whether they wanted to be eaten or not and i couldn‚Äôt eat animal crackers but we can‚Äôt ban animal crackers because of that‚Äù last i checked i‚Äôm not an animal cracker and people in general aren‚Äôt animal crackers to compare the two is faulty logic his position as is the erroenous one of many others remained that the image could be used to educate since it was already there he also said that we should work with the prochief people because they were the ones offended and they were not going to let go of their mascot easily and that because the tradition was embedded strongly people might even turn to some ‚Äúgood ole vigilante justice‚Äù this is the kind of student who you protect and the student who in your recent sell out with the honor the chief society will be able to continue performing in regalia the event ended and everyone went their separate ways again it was clear that the prochief side has no real goal besides bringing the chief back dozier claims to want educational efforts to happen but i have never seen him at the native american house for any event nor have i seen the prochief side with its thousands of supporters hold an event to honor native people the closest i have seen have either been hosted by the native american house the native american and indigenous student organization and the archeology student society naiso and the archeology student society in fact held an amazing event called indivisible at which i did not see nativeloving chief supporters at and so this is my condensed testament about my experience at the university of illinois these are the kinds of students who are on your campus and this is the situation you have neglected and even encouraged through your settlement i leave thoroughly disappointed with you chancellor wise the board of trustees the office of the dean of students the office of diversity equity and access and the college of liberal arts and sciences for having done nothing to address this horrendous issue none of which achieved their mission to support and most importantly protect minority students on campus i may not matter because i am not one of the wealthy alumni who can threaten this institution by withholding my funds but i have a voice and i will be now and forever an alumni who will make sure that other students are aware that the racism and culture of silence and apathy is so fully embedded into this place that it is truly dangerous to be a student here if you want to do something i suggest you enforce the wonderful language you use in your statements and handbooks i suggest that you start with the classroom environment and demand that students and professors act in accordance to the rules set by the university and refrain from wearing any and all items which may include the word ‚Äúchief‚Äù that may contain the image of the former mascot and any likeness to it which includes but is not limited to sweaters shirts jerseys buttons and stickers which are triggering and which interfere with not only the quality of education but also the emotional wellbeing of students of course you will find yourself attacked if you do this because the prochief side does not want to change but change is necessary and overdue i hope that you take it upon yourself to act until then i will work hard to reach american indian and indigenous people to stay far from this university to look elsewhere for their education because this university does not have the capacity to create a safe environment for them and i would not want them to feel as i have there are far better institutions for them than yours zenka tlazohcamati xochitl

2023-06-14 15:41:51,https://redd.it/149ik1i,124,is my roommates behaviour considered racist can i do something about it,my housemate is a female student of environmental engineering she is from bangladesh i am a black girl from south america i am in vet school i think she has racist behaviours against me but i am not sure if this is cultural or normal i still will have to live with her due to the contract so what do you think i am not pointing out anything but i would like to know other opinions she has done this kind of things among many others she commented several times she likes to hang out or live close just with people from bangladesh she did a celebration with her friends all from bangladesh and she invited me to join the food time we were sitting all in the living room then i thought this was really nice of her so i started to be friendly and try to talk to them in english of course because all of us spoke english they ignored my friendly questions and refused to speak english or to me at all and then they started to speak in their own language so i can not understand for 30 minutes in front of me wtf oo the only thing i could understand was the word roommate i left after that we went for a walk with her and in the middle of the walk she said oh i am here with you because all my bangladesh friends are busy is this because i am black or just from a different culture besides that she is just a terrible roommate she cooks at 3 am and makes the fire alarm jump leaves always plates unwashed the kitchen dirty and leaves the bathroom extremely dirty her room also smells pretty bad a lot of times i asked her to improve this but it was pointless anyway is there anything i can do with respect to that like at least put her on the spot so she has to attend some kind of discriminatory or inclusivity lecture ps why will you come to a new country and not try to be respectful and tolerant with people that are not from your home country i have lived in different countries in america and europe and i know how different cultures can be but that is why it is beautiful to travel you get out of your box and realize that your culture is not the best and that the truth is there is no best culture editsomeone made me realize thisif there is a white girl telling a black girl that she just hangs out with white girls and trying to humiliate the black girl in front of her friends by speaking a language she does not know for 30 minutes then i am pretty sure the university will not call this normal behaviour maybe not racist but it will definitely be considered a behaviour that creates a horrible environment for inclusivity then why it can be considered ok when it is not a white girl the one doing this pd hasta creo que le molesta cuando hago mi famosa pasta con vinito

2017-11-20 01:52:41,https://redd.it/7e7b9i,0,does grainger ever get cleaned,hello im just gonna put it out there first that this is gonna be something of a rant so theres my warning anyways as a freshman engineer i study at grainger practically everyday and back when i toured the campus in high school i viewed grainger as one of the most beautiful and splendid parts of campus but now that i actually use this space ive noticed that its quite disgusting if looked at on a deeper closer level consider the following observations of mine ‚Ä¢ grainger has these big tables with lamps in the openceiling area on the 2nd floor each table has four plug points on the side which are part of an extension cord the thing is over 80 of those dont work the plugs on the other end of the extension cords are just left unplugged and although there is clearly some power outlet underneath the floor there is some door covering it which cannot be opened without a key so basically theres no way to charge your laptop or phone at those tables ‚Ä¢ the 2nd floor also has these selfstudy areas on the sides of the building where the individual desks are separated by walls the first thing youll notice when sitting down at one of these is the countless strands of hair pieces of dandruff and boogers sitting on the desktop half of the attached lamps dont work either what the actual fk ‚Ä¢ now well move onto the bathrooms be prepared i have no idea how the girls have it but its a horror story for the guys the rims of the urinals have countless spots of dried up urine and so does the floor underneath the urinals on the 4th floor are broken and theyve been like that for literally 3 months now yuck yes i know how immature and unwarranted this rant is i had always expected a library catered to engineers in an underfunded institution to be somewhat unhygienic but this is just too much no wonder they give vaccinations on the first floor all the time am i really paying 50k a year to never see a janitor in my library well if anyone knows the people responsible for the librarys maintenance please tell them about these conditions and maybe even show them this post please spread awareness in general whether it be through email social media word of mouth or even the meme page thank you very much

2015-03-21 18:28:53,https://redd.it/2zuqk8,0,freshman of university of illinois housing where should i live next year official,university of illinois housing decision post official hello freshman congrats on your acceptance to the university of illinois many of you are signing up for dorm housing as of now and may be asked to rank your choices in order this is a very big decision and a year long commitment where you house will very likely determine some of your best friends as well as give you unmatched connections the dorm will be your home for the next year so choosing wisely is a must my name is illiniclark and this sign up process for me was very confusing last year sure you could could try googling your way to figure out what the ‚Äúmost social‚Äù hall is or which house has the ‚Äúmost fun‚Äù however besides for receiving a formal answer you will not get an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù review i hope you take into consideration that this review is from the perspective of just one person i will try to keep the facts straight but please keep that in mind enjoy the read nestled between one of the best recreational facilities in the midwest the arc and the ikenberry common area study rooms dining hall and 57 north lay a multitude of unique dorms we will start off with a comprehensive breakdown of the ‚Äú6pack area‚Äù the six pack is on the exact opposite side of the engineering campus and is considered to contain the most social halls due to it‚Äôs large concentration of students 1 snyder hall snyder hall is the southernmost hall and was my home for my freshman year snyder hall is a substance free hall however do not let those words detract you from it‚Äôs appeal keep in mind by law every dorm is required to be substance free the difference between other halls and snyder is snyder does not have ‚Äúwrite ups‚Äùor ‚Äústrikes‚Äù while most dorms have a 3 strike system snyder tends to expel students or ‚Äúkick them out‚Äù to other dorms instantly if they are caught belligerently drunk or with weed and alcohol in their rooms there are no ‚Äústrikes‚Äù for substance related matters it is possible to keep alcohol and weed in the room for storage but it is well advised to consume the substances outside of snyder premises many of you may think that ‚Äúsnyderians‚Äù don‚Äôt turn up however individuals from snyder come from all walks of life in fact some of the craziest party girls and studs i have met have been from snyder a great benefit of substance free is that the dorm is cleaner than most less people throwing up drunk in the halls snyder is the closest housing facility to the arc so for those who love hitting the gym this location is premier 2 weston hall weston hall is just north of snyder and closest to the ikenberry commons dining hall weston is equipped with a study basement where students are allowed to study or take classes many call weston the ‚Äúparty hall‚Äù due to lax ra‚Äôs this is a good hall for students who are comfortable with drinking students planning on joining greek life weston has a large rush majority and individuals who like to have fun some of the prettiest girls and best looking guys live in weston 3 scott hallhopkins hall scott hall is west of snyder scott has an excellent lobby for studying the atmosphere is much more relaxed than snyder in terms of drinking however it is calmer than that of weston‚Äôs it is quite standard in terms of dorms scott is equipped with newer model desks and beds hopkins has the same vibe as scott however is home to many of the universities great athletes 4 tvd taftvan doran is not technically part of the ‚Äú6 pack‚Äù however is right next to snyder tvd does not have airconditioning and the rooms are smaller than standard keep this in mind when applying however tvd is known to have the ‚Äúchillest‚Äù ra‚Äôs drinking is abundant and unlike other dorms‚Ä¶if you are smart you could party in the dorm however the size is small so it is best equipped for pregames 5 nugent nugent is one the newest dorms on campus it is connected to the ikenberry commonssdrp the facility is hotel like and very posh however nugent is reserved for mostly older students 6 bousfield the newest dorms on campus compared to the likes of a hotel suite bousfield has one of the nicest dorm facilities in the midwest reservations start early and usually the dorm is filled up within 2 hours reserved almost exclusively for older students 7 lundgren all male dorm enough said 8 bartonbevans all female dorm again it is how you would think it is 9 next right near the engineering campus we have the illinois street residence or better known as isr isr is a primal hub of engineers and physicians from all over the country though many students hold the classic ‚Äúengineering student‚Äù stereotype many are very social isr is equipped with it‚Äôs own dining hall and is composed of many different sub sections though many would prefer the 6pack to isr for it‚Äôs social aspect isr is filled with multiple lobbies lounges and study rooms where students can mingle and complete group projects though isr is located very close to the engineering campus it is very far from the arc the people who i know from isr have mixed reviews about the place while many do love it it seems like an equal amount would have preferred a spot in the sixpack 10 farparallenlar yes the name is fitting this place is far the least popular dorm and honestly a hassle to get to the best thing about far is that is across par par has the best dining hall food on campus par is very social and students are always entering for a chance to try their ‚Äúfamous‚Äù stir fry though many people love par they do not like it‚Äôs distance from ‚Äúeverything else‚Äù just like isr these buildings can consist of many floors and subdorms these students have access to another athletic recreation center known as crce crce is not as grand as the arc however does have a hottub allen is right next to the mckinley health center and does not have airconditioning lar is also in this vicinity i have never been inside either so if anyone can add their experience in the comments that would be greatly appreciated i hope this concise break down helps you make your decision for next year if you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments for any current students please feel free to make suggestions or additions this post is open for editing and change thanks so much for taking the time to read this love illiniclark

2016-03-27 11:29:58,https://redd.it/4c653p,1,uiucs gradebooks,is it just me or is everyone else frustrated with the million different gradebook systems we have at uiuc right now and not a single one of them properly display grades its starting to really get on my nerves that we pay 30000 every school year for a big 10 school that cant even dictate a singular and proper grading system we have atlas loncapa moodle and compass hell theres probably even more that most of us arent used to i think its pretty disappointing when professors cant either input grades properly or uiuc cant create a coherent gradebook system we have one of the best it departments in the nation but we still fail to create a proper system that allows someone to check all their grades from one organized place i mean not a single gradebook lets you know the letter grade you have in class enterprise might but its only for midterm grades or final grades in a class also why cant these professors hire tas that can properly handle a grading system if you arent gonna use a single consolidated gradebook at least use the million different ones that are there properly i mean specifically on compass the grades are never weighted for their categories like whats the point of having a grading system when i have to make an excel sheet for each class to accurately calculate my grade there im done venting now

2022-01-14 17:20:52,https://redd.it/s45nop,0,free breakfast program,given that were all coming back to campus and getting situated i think its time for us to form a free breakfast program a student led and run program that provides free breakfast to every single student undergraduate phd graduate university staff and every single university affiliated person on this campus we run on donations and make easy and affordable food ex hotdog con huevo we find a place on campus that lets us cook this food and during a certain timeframe we just give out free food we dont run as a non profit or a 501c3 we make this program because this is what our university and our government should be doing if they wanted to fix our right now problems they could but they never will in the dining hall it was the norm that edible food was consistently thrown away because it wasnt used in restaurants on this campus food is constantly being thrown away why not make a partnership with those restaurants who employs students to give us the food they would usually throw out it would give us extra food that they arent using and it would push then to only use as much as needed i dont think people who are food insecure on this campus or people who are hungry are going to wait until their party expands their seats in the legislature just for them to do nothing i dont know where our tuition money is going but i know its sure as hell aint benefitting us our tuition money aint going towards mental health or the expensive books on top of our sky rocketing tuition it isnt going towards required textbooks that are valued at 150 or a bullshit access fee you can only get at the bookstore or a syllabus that doesnt allow for breaks and relaxation our money is going towards fucking us over in every single aspect i think yall if were going to be study specific fields then as future professionals of our field of study we should get to decide the very nature of of our field where it matters the most if we decide that we need a minute to relax or a curved grade or sharing a collective textbook we could find online for free then its not completely out of line for us to demand a better college experience we are consistently getting screwed and bent over every single day with the next year being worse than the previous one they give us a right to an education and they punish us for having that right so if they arent looking out for us its time for us to look out for each other we start with a free breakfast program or move it a little later in the day for dinner or whatever listen do any of us have any idea on how to do this or our taxes no we dont but we are all that is left just a bunch of college students who die laughing at a picture of lightning mcqueen named b l o c k it is time for us to take action

2020-03-12 17:52:12,https://redd.it/fhpcct,19,to professors who are currently figuring out how to do online classes please dont make me download and use questionable software eg zoom alternatives included,hello ive seen a lost of posts where people are confused about the best way to handle the new online class mandate so i wanted to offer some hopefully useful advice my main point is to avoid using software that students must download to their computer and can instead use in a web browser this is desirable because it guarantees platform support anywhere that has a functional web browser which is basically everywhere and keep in mind that some students may want to use a computer that they cant install things on such as in a public library i hope that i can convince you of that and provide useful advice regardless in this post another very important thing that i would like to mention is that zoom although it has nominal support for linux has really questionable support in practice last year i had to do an online class that used zoom and it was a constant and neverending string of issues both for me and others who were not on linux despite my best efforts to solve these issues it would be really helpful to avoid using it for this reason alone even putting aside my other concerns for lectures there are a variety of options that work in a web browser eg twitch and youtube streaming thus eliminating the need for anyone to download anything and guaranteeing that the software will work everywhere eg linux the free and open source open broadcasting softwarehttpsobsprojectcom can connect to these services very easily and stream your computers screen eg for a powerpoint presentation input from a webcam or both at the same time eg pictureinpicture there are also alternatives to obs but they tend to cost some money herehttpswwwtomsguidecomushowtostreamtotwitchnews21077html is a tutorial for how to stream to twitch although these platforms and tools are usually used only for gaming they have reliable and battletested infrastructure run by companies with massive infrastructure youtube owns google and amazon owns twitch for streaming arbitrary videos which makes them a great option for the current needs one of my professors last semester held office hours on twitch for example presumably just to make it more convenient for students their main issue however is that these platforms make interaction somewhat more difficult since anyone who isnt doing the main stream needs to type their questions etc and send them this isnt really an issue in most lectures but where more direct interaction is desired eg office hours discussion sections than in a lecture i would like to recommend two different tools discord and jami discord recently upped its maximum number of people in a conference call to 50 with screen sharing video chat etc and it allows voice servers with an unlimited number of people to allow natural conversations to take place like twitch and youtube their infrastructure is battletested and cloud hosted so it can expand to meet demand very quickly and can be used in a web browser native clients including for mobile exist too for those who prefer that with discord you can quite easily setup a server and then share a link to students eg via email which then will work in a web browser it also has great tools that will allow you to police the server eg to remove someone who is causing trouble and i have experience using it in my server of almost 1000 people ‚Äî it works well jami is a free and open source alternative to skype the features that it offers are very similar but it has much better platform support with first class clients for windows mac linux android phones iosapple mobile devices and android tvs and completely avoids any sort of centralized server altogether thus eliminating any real concern about capacity for the added load jami is however a bit harder to use and lacks a web client so discord is probably the better option i mention jami just to have a backup in place in the unlikely scenario that discord has issues

2023-01-09 12:02:03,https://redd.it/107l4gc,1,my thoughts on transferring into cs,after 3 semesters here ive recently gotten the update that allowed me to transfer to grainger cs from prep when i was a freshman i was intially scared off by a lot of the posts advising people to go elsewhere rather than transfer in but decided to take the gamble anyways the stark contrast i had with a lot of those posts was my overall positive experience with the entire transfer process as a result i wanted to leave some of my thoughts behind to future aspiring cs x transfers on some qualities and reasons you should have to benefit from coming here to transfer into cs x200b thrive under stress coming here to transfer into cs is filled with uncertainty and pressure to get high grades in almost all of your classes youll have to self learn and adapt quickly for many that can lead to burnout and lack of motivation for a few it can push them to achieve more than they could before competitiveness knowing that you have to compete with many other students for a few cs spots can be very demoralizing if you do not like being competitive but if you love being competitive this can be a very exciting and stressful part of your life uiuc specialties if you just want to get into faangbig tech uiucs name brand will not magically do the work for you and many other schools are fully capable of getting you there that being said if you really want to get into a select few trading firms or work with a specific professor coming here for something you cant get somewhere else could be a smart move acceptance picture yourself in 12 years you just got rejected from the cs program you hoped you would be able to transfer into your options are to select another major or transfer to a different college is this a result you can accept if you cannot treasure the things you can expereince and learn here over the degree then coming here is just a gamble x200b the majority of people do not embody all of these traits as a result i wouldnt reccomend attempting coming here just to transfer into cs for most people but if you strongly resonate and understand the things i just listed i think youll have a positive expereince here regardless of if you transfer in successfully or not

2015-02-22 15:02:58,https://redd.it/2wsoq2,0,reply to user windydruid who complained about his delivery job,tipping 35 dollars 3040 on an 10 order seems silly not to mention theres usually a 150 delivery fee 0501 which goes into a drivers pocket and covers at least 7 miles of gas a 12 tip seems fair maybe 35 if it is an especially far trip or bad weather also why do delivery drivers expect to get tipped a ridiculous amount when the bill cost more whether someone orders 50 of food or 5 of food the amount of work the driver does does not change if anything the people who spend 30 minutes making the really large order should get a generous tip not the driver who did no extra work if youre averaging over minimum wage in a lower level position in fast food you shouldnt be complaining to the customers

2018-04-09 20:47:00,https://redd.it/8b3yk2,54,cs makes me sick,as a cs major myself cs was once cool and fancy to me it was indeed pretty cool at 200 level classes when people ask what my major is i proudly told them i am cs and then there is immediately the impression you are so smart i used to enjoy this kinda of feeling but after 2 years in cs i have become sickened and disgusted by this major and the cs stereotype that could be found on at least half of kids cs people think they are the best of the world smarter than all other people they look down upon all other majors they think people studying humanities are either dumb or stupid they might not appear it but thats what they think low key there are too many occasions that when they heard someone is studying majors like history or philosophy they have the expression that why do you study that are you gonna find a job at all cs people always think what they are doing is the most important in this world this selfimportance is even more exaggerated when they go to career fairs after all almost half of companies in career fair want cs people but you are just a replaceable screw in such field with countless brilliant minds i just don‚Äôt understand what make cs people feel so good about themselves come on it‚Äôs just a living with better pays i would rather live with 60k a year being interesting rather than 120k being boring cs people are incredibly boring when i dine with cs people either in large group or onetoone the topic is always gonna be about four things class homework research and interview there seems to be nothing else in their life if there is it‚Äôs probably video game this is also largely true for the people working in the industry i have interned at a top silicon valley tech company i tried to talk about something other than technical or working stuff i mean i know pretty a lot stuff and can discuss intellectually on most topics but the colleagues in my group just can‚Äôt keep the conversation informative and inspiring some people enjoy cs technical jokes come on by all means they are lame uninteresting uncool and not funny at all no people outside the field will like them it only makes you nerdier occasionally my friends will ask for some easy geneds they don‚Äôt care the slightest about whether the professor is interesting or fun they don‚Äôt care whether the course provides real inspiration or broadens version they just want geneds not to be the burden of their life how pathetic i mean you guys paid thousands of dollars a year just to take some easy boring classes uiuc is probably not the most prestigious institutions for humanities and arts but its offering of geneds courses is full and complete and fairly good there is just plenty of cs courses and coding tutorials online that are no worse than uiuc cs course offering why the heck you go to college anyway cs people are just bunch of programmers as they tell the computer to do whatever they want they are just told to do whatever the their boss wants there is very little to none creativity artistry or craftsmanship of any kind it‚Äôs not my personal opinion it‚Äôs true i‚Äôve been a software engineer you can go to street or anywhere and ask which is cooler an artist or a software engineer i doubt if there will be many would answer software engineer i‚Äôm determined that i will stay away from cs for my entire life its good to know the knowledge though cs people don‚Äôt have souls not all of them but a great number of them as jeff hammberbacher the guy who cofounded cloudera famously said ‚Äúthe best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads that sucks‚Äù i don‚Äôt know whether i should feel sorry or feel angry it certainly makes me sad being smart is certainly great but intelligence should be used on more interesting stuff i respect that people‚Äôs wish to be financially successful and i understand that for smart kids cs is a shortcut but i just want to tell you world is not all about cs there are plenty of interesting things out there to be discovered i have no complaint if you tried bit of everything and finally find that cs is your love but it would be the stupidest of you to think cs the greatest of all while being ignorant of other stuff and feeling complacent about yourself unfortunately based on my observation it is happening pervasively among cs people i respect those people who are truly attracted to cs and have the determination to devote life to it be a professor etc at least some of you should draw a clear line between what is work and what is real meaning of life i wish this post would make a difference although i don‚Äôt have much confidence in that people just forget about this in day and continue their cycle of lecture deadline interview and video games now when people ask for my major i tell them it doesn‚Äôt matter know all those above because i meet them every single for the past 2 years i know these people too well yes i use pronoun they when i talk about cs people i used to be one of them but not any more

bias im sorry idk if this post is more for incoming freshman to prevent them from making the mistake i did or just to see if im not alone in feeling like this anyway welcome to my ted talk here are 6 legitimate reasons why you should not come to u of i or at least why i regret it 1 manyhttpswwwratemyprofessorscomshowratingsjsptid2036750 lowerlevel gen ed professorshttpswwwratemyprofessorscomshowratingsjsptid2102985 are absolute craphttpswwwratemyprofessorscomshowratingsjsptid2116847 not all and no not just now due to covid for the most part many just don‚Äôt teach well i‚Äôve noticed rampant ‚Äúpurchasing of curriculum‚Äù aka a university will buy its lesson plans and homework from a corporation to save time rather than a professor trying to actually teach a group of students in their own way with their own lesson plan and in a school of 40000 students obviously you‚Äôre just ‚Äúanother number‚Äù to them think of a teacher you‚Äôve had in middlehigh school if you were struggling academically in their class they‚Äôd take a concern for you right well at u of i they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs 100 their fault im not saying theyre bad people but it‚Äôs an absolute fact of life here the environment is just not tailored for learning school of course will have an element of stress to it but all of my classes feel very ‚Äúride or die‚Äù in the sense that they don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre assigning too much homework for you to actually take time and learn so you need to blow through the homework as fast as possible google answers many will chegg it etc so you can get 46 hours of sleep to wake up the next morning and attend a lecture youll likely sleep through to any teachers reading this dumping more homework for practice is not always the answer and since the average gpa is low anywayhttpwafcsillinoisedudiscoverygpaofeverycourseatillinois even if you have pretty much all bs and cs that kill your gpa you‚Äôre kind of written off in a ‚Äúcs get degrees‚Äù manner 2 nobody respects a u of i degree not as much as they should at least considering how much work it is it‚Äôs just the truth no matter how much u of i brags about how fantastic their engineeringcomp sci curriculum is it‚Äôs not caltech it‚Äôs not mit its not duke its not cornell its not berkely its not carnegie mellon its not nyu not even fricken umich in terms of brand recognition at least yes i know some us college news whatever probably rates us higher than those schools but how many laypeople really believe that if you asked them hell people around the world think ucla is a better school overall and ucla is a party school on the beach of california ü§£ to the us and maybe the world if anyone outside the midwest and china has even heard of us u of i is ‚Äújust another state school‚Äù lumped with msu isu niu wiu eiu siu uwm iowa state ohio state iowa and pretty much any other blandass cornfield midwestern state school you can think of in fact u of is trashy party school reputation unofficial anyone also tarnishes how hard youll likely have to work here and if you disagree with me which you have every right to answer this the last time someone asked you where you go to school what was their reaction to you saying u of i oh wow you must be brilliant aka the average reaction to say columbia engineering despite us ranking higher or oh cool honestly so many people can‚Äôt even pronounce the name righthttpswwwredditcomruiuccommentsgfhk8lmymomcanneverrememberthenameofthisschool ü§£ 3 scheduling classes is awful you know how in high school you might ask your friends ‚Äúwhich teacher is better‚Äù ‚Äúwho‚Äôs more fair‚Äù etc since u of i has so many students i dont think they want us doing that otherwise one professor would get like 800 students and another would get 10 so every time i look on enhanced registration apparently only one professor is named to teach the class for every sectionreally u of i so both this semester and last i got stuck with godawful professors that literally have 15s online and student reviews echoing the same concerns as me teaches way too fast might as well skip the lectures etc 4 your curriculum plan will be haphazard at best and make you suicidal at worst yes i chose engineering yes engineering is hard i know but i should not have to take at least 17 credit hours for five semesters straighthttpsbioengineeringillinoisedufilesundergraduatecurriculummapsbioengineeringcurriculummap1pdf especially not when theyve got us taking math 231 phys 211 mcb 150 and chem 104 all at the same time in order to avoid taking a 20 credit workload next semester extra required classes to the 17 long story i need to take 7 credits at a community college over the summer but since u of i is high and mighty 7 community college credits only counts for 4 u of i credits so i still need to take 16 credits next semester so basically i need to take extra school just to be taking a normal workload which makes no sense why was a curriculum made this way to be so impossible to fit normally the u of i tuition is bad enough as it is now youre gonna make me stay longer 5 continuing on 4 an obnoxiously timeconsuminghardass curriculum throws away any chances of having fun at u of i u of i is a party school if you‚Äôre doing a fricken easy major sorry its true for engineers it feels cold miserable and unforgiving which connects back to 2 because despite u of i being very hard anyone who actually knows our little patch of hell in the cornfields more than likely thinks of it as a party schoolfrat haven obviously the reaction of me saying to people ‚Äúi‚Äôm a u of i student‚Äù is gonna be much different than say ‚Äúi‚Äôm an mit student‚Äù or even im a umich student so you get the partyschool dumbass reputation without the fun partyschool dumbassery to go with it 6 also on the ‚Äúfun‚Äù scene unless you‚Äôre getting shitfaced at kams the local
