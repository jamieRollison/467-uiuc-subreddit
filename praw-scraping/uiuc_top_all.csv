2021-11-15 22:15:15,https://redd.it/quz6if,1594,im tired of the fetishization of cs majors,the females on this campus are out of control the first time i ate lunch wearing my grainger cs shirt with fully covered legs mind you i had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me like i would know how to talk to a girl i quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool why shame me for being smart anyway that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and i am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me ive taken to moving all the other chairs at tables i sit at to other tables but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last mp girl i dont struggle with mps im a cs major not csx after making it markedly clear that i did not in fact want to copulate in the isr bathroom she finally left me alone but i wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because i am enrolled in the hardest program on campus which was not difficult for me to get into by the way the worst are when students from nontechnical majors talk to me well be having a nice platonic conversation when they inevitably ask the fateful question whats your major as soon as i say those two magnificent letters i see their whole demeanor change the doe eyes the flushed cheeks the jiggling cleavage what makes an art major think they have a chance with me faa and grainger are on whole different planes of existence im not about to impregnate somebody that paints happy little trees for work you may think im just remarkably handsome which i am but my attractive acquaintances in ece theyre not smart enough to be friends but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures females see me as an object and a genius when really im so much more im top 100 in the world in destiny 2 my gray shirt shouldnt reduce me to a bag of meat if you want my heart you have to grind with me raid with me join my clan and most of all watch rick and morty with me and understand it no fake fans that shout pickle rick like its some kind of joke when its really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3 not that i cried if you want somebody for cheap sex the ece majors are right there i dont blame you for avoiding cs x though stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control i didnt want to be born a super genius hell sometimes i wish i was an ece major moving through the world in ignorant bliss but i have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next facebook seductively touching grainger bob isnt going to make me want to get with you come back in a morty costume code a y combinator or implement djikstras recursively and then well talk,Social,0.56207

2021-02-17 19:41:05,https://redd.it/lmajmi,1542,my name is ivor thank you all for the support heres what i want to say,to my fellow graduate researchers professors undergraduate students first of all i want to thank all the students for their incredible support in the last few days i want to thank everyone on the geo team for all the work done on my behalf and i want to thank all the professors and staff members who went out of their ways to help me thank you all very much now your voices are heard on february 16th dean justin brown informed me that the disciplinary committee modified my punishments to 1 dismissal held in abeyance conduct probation 2 two 1000words essays and 3 25hour community service i intend to accept the punishment this is not the best result one can hope for but it is something i can swallow in the last few days i have read and heard many stories of how the universitys inconsiderate policies and disciplinary actions affected students lives since my case is now out in the open and since i have 18000 signatures on my petition it is my responsibility to step up and say something to the universitys administration certainly i do not claim to represent anyone but myself and what i am about to propose is nothing but a piece of personal opinion but i do hope it can stimulate widespread discussions among students and faculty members with sufficient debates and discussions it is my hope that we could present our collective opinion to the university administration to call for a more transparent and humane covid19 policy proposal 1 disciplinary sanctions should be nuanced tiered and educational in nature in response to reported noncompliance the covid19 response team should 1 on first report send a written personal notice to remind the student of his or her alleged noncompliance to inform the student of detailed covid19 policies and to offer help if the student has special conditions preventing him or her from participating in covid19 testing program 2 on second report the student should expect to have an informal meeting with the covid19 response team to discuss his or her alleged noncompliance during the meeting the student should be informed clearly of the consequence of further noncompliance 3 formal procedure of student disciplinary process will start on the third report 2 severity of disciplinary sanctions should depend primarily on the impact of the alleged noncompliance medicalpublichealth experts from mckinley or college of medicine should assess the impact of the alleged noncompliance the assessment criterion should be made open and transparent the student disciplinary office should not be involved in this assessment process 3 undergraduate who missed a test should be notified through safer illinois app one day after a missed test the student shall see a warning message in the app and shall be denied access to campus buildings the warning message should contain contact information of covid19 response team in order to provide the student with an opportunity to resolve his or her situation two days after a missed test the same message shall be repeated to the student three days after a missed test the noncompliance should be reported to the covid19 response team 4 university covid19 policies should treat graduate researchers the same way as faculty members and staff this includes an automatic exemption from testing if the graduate researcher is 100 remote this university is blessed with the best professors and the best students hence the administrators have a duty of care especially in the time of upheaval and uncertainty as my professors have written in their letter of support uiuc has distinguished itself as a national leader in controlling covid19 strict enforcement of student conduct violations has been an essential element of this success but it is equally important that the university maintains its commitment to a just and nuanced student conduct system in which the punishment fits the violation the universitys reputation regarding the fairness with which it arbitrates the student conduct violations will last far longer than the current pandemic thank you all very much ivor,COVID-19,0.8601999999999999

2021-05-11 14:05:40,https://redd.it/na4t53,732,the retreat has an illegal lease please be careful if you are thinking about signing,im making this post to help any uiuc students who are maybe thinking about signing at the retreat on lincoln ave or for students who are currently living here and renewed for next year and tbh i know that a lot of landlords do not respect student rights so please hear me out sorry if this is long i just want to make sure i get across to other people that this is not a good place for students what happened last week the maintenance person at the retreat walked into my bedroom while i was asleep and woke me up to ask me questions about my apartment i was not dressed and i was trying to sleep in bc it was reading day keep in mind that this is a man i dont know standing in a 23 yr old girls bedroom while she is not dressed i told him that he shouldnt be in my apartment and definitely not in my bedroom because i did not receive a 24 hour notice and also bc why would anyone enter someone elses home and wake them up however he stayed in my apartment for another few minutes despite me being suuuuuper uncomfortable this is the 3rd time this maintenance person has walked into my apartment for inspections without a notice while i was asleep in urbana entry without a 24 hr notice is illegal unless for emergencies when i told one of the managers logan what happened they instead started trying to shift the blame on me by mentioning that my boyfriend sometimes sleeps at my place which has nothing to do with any of this they refused to take blame and instead threatened me i called the police who told me that contacting the student legal services was a better option this is where the legality of their contract comes in i contacted the student legal services and showed them the lease which states that the staff at the retreat can enter an apartment of a resident whenever they want without a notice the attorney confirmed that this is illegal and therefore the maintenance person should have been arrested for his actions specifically the illegal contract states landlord and its agents employees contractors representatives and service providers shall have the right to enter the bedroom and unit at all reasonable hours or in the event of an emergency at any time without notice to resident and without resident‚Äôs consent the law always trumps a contract by entering my apartment freely and without my consent puts me and my privacy at risk and honestly it puts the maintenance person at risk as well what if i thought he was a home invader and i tried to protect myself with a weapon please do not sign a lease with the retreat until they fix this illegal clause they do not respect students and they do not respect laws on our privacy and if you currently live here write an email to the urbana mayor diane marlin dwmarlinurbanaillinoisusmailtodwmarlinurbanaillinoisus and copy her on the lease im graduating this week so i want to make sure i protect my uiuc friends even after i leave here edit thank you guys for being so nice and giving me good advice 3 makes me happy that people care,Housing,0.48122

2021-07-30 10:39:35,https://redd.it/oun098,734,hi my name is megan and im asking you to wear a mask,x200b yeah i see my thumb but i had a catheter in me so i will not be blamed for thishttpspreviewredditvx8u10ujbde71jpgwidth850formatpjpgautowebps51335d7e0929eb6693a4647150e0b07b8eaeb01d hi my name is megan this picture is of me several years ago in the hospital a day after a heart surgeon had pulled a tumor the size of a stick of butter out of my chest it had been wrapping itself around my airway at the time ‚Äì i went in thinking i had walking pneumonia and came out with a cancer diagnosis it sucked but i lived but it also took 7 months of aggressive chemo to make sure i lost my hair i felt like crap some days but again i lived so it all worked out i was 37 at the time today i work at grainger library and i‚Äôm here to do two things put a human face on someone at risk and make a request i‚Äôm asking that you wear masks yes even if you‚Äôre vaccinated i know it sucks it also sucks for me ‚Äì believe me i have the perspective of someone who had to carry around a liter of chemo liquid as it continuously pumped fluid so noxious into my veins that they had to use a chest port to get it there lest it dissolve my flesh so yeah masks do suck ‚Äì i‚Äôm with ya but even though i‚Äôm vaccinated the idea of being one of the breakthrough cases and dying on a ventilator sucks even more i didn‚Äôt survive cancer to die of a soupedup flu we‚Äôve been here all year ‚Äì the staff at grainger we were here even before the vaccine was released and if you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúsure you‚Äôre paid to be there‚Äù yeah but check the salaries for library civil service sometime while i know i‚Äôm lucky to make what i make i know there are folks way worse off than me i‚Äôm also not sipping mimosas poolside after work i make enough to have both a playstation and an xbox i didn‚Äôt have to choose üòâ but i‚Äôm not doing this work because i make the big bucks i‚Äôm doing it because i‚Äôve always loved working in libraries i‚Äôve been doing it since i was an undergrad i knew i wasn‚Äôt going to be a researcher curing cancer or an engineer figuring out how to make earthquake proof buildings ‚Äì but i was good at finding stuff for people and maybe i could help someone find the information they needed to cure cancer or make earthquake proof buildings and that philosophy is why the head of the grainger engineering library wanted us to try really hard to make sure we remained open even during the worst of it we wanted you to have as much of that college experience as possible and we wanted to support you in your work i know there are some of you who think this will ruin your college experience ‚Äì but trust me i also have perspective on that my parents couldn‚Äôt afford to house me in a dorm so i lived with them my first two years at college no one wanted to come to my place to hang out i was isolated and unable to connect to almost anyone by the time i was a junior and could afford my own place everyone had grouped up college wasn‚Äôt the same for me as it was for everyone on campus i made exactly one college friend i don‚Äôt have any fond memories of college other than some of the professors i was able to get classes with i‚Äôm not trying to whine i‚Äôm fine i‚Äôm not unhappy with my life but i know right now today there are students out there in similar situations ‚Äì due to finances or physical limitations ‚Äì who are absolutely not ever going to get the chances you have mask or no they are unhappy and wish a mask was the only thing holding them back from having the time of their life not even my graduate school experience was untainted ‚Äì i still remember the vibe of coming to work at aces one day to see everyone staring at their computer monitors watching cnn that fateful day in september but we all got through that too we carried on and coped in our own ways even so i feel for each and every one of you who has to go through this i too was excited when the mask mandate ended i supervise 10 graduate assistants some of whom will never know what uiuc campus life is like since they were so bummed over the last year they finished the degree in a year and a summer to get it over with i am absolutely in pain on their behalf i hate this is what they got college is expensive a huge time investment and a lot of emotions are tied up into the promise of what the experience could be i get it but i‚Äôm still asking you to mask up because it‚Äôs not safe yet and maybe you still don‚Äôt care ‚Äì you‚Äôre not in a highrisk group sure but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt get it and spread it and every person on this campus that you come into contact with now has to take that particular risk with you only their odds aren‚Äôt as good all these people are here to support your college experience while you get to have it have little say in the matter if you refuse to mask up we have to work to earn a paycheck and pay bills rent put food on the table etc the head of this library is in his 70s there are more than a few folks who work here with comorbidities we‚Äôve all been vaccinated but breakthrough cases happen httpswwwpbsorgnewshourhealthbreakthroughcovidinfectionsshowtheunvaccinatedarenowputtingthevaccinatedatriskhttpswwwpbsorgnewshourhealthbreakthroughcovidinfectionsshowtheunvaccinatedarenowputtingthevaccinatedatrisk ‚Äì and they are more likely to happen the more you‚Äôre exposed delta is scary we‚Äôre filled with anxiety our blood pressure is up our mental fatigue is high and we don‚Äôt have the option of being 20 anymore but we‚Äôre still here we‚Äôve kept at it all through the last year and we‚Äôll keep at it again this year and all we‚Äôre asking you to do to help us out is wear a mask maybe i‚Äôm biased but i like not dying of covid i like not risking even a terrible horrible no good flu i like being safe if wearing a piece of cloth on my face is the price i have to pay not to have covid wreck my life or the lives of those i work with i‚Äôll do it finally please don‚Äôt direct your anger at those asking you to mask up the maskers are probably all vaccinated were just scared people we‚Äôre having to mask up again because some folks have been fooled into thinking a virus votes and has political reasoning and those folks are keeping this thing going and making it worse changing covid as it multiplies and mutates in their bodies so that our protection becomes less effective with each iteration saying the masks will never end and this is just one long step in forever is missing the point if everyone got vaccinated or if even enough of us did we‚Äôd be back on track to demask help educate yourself and others so they make safe choices thats truly the only way well beat this

2022-01-05 11:54:24,https://redd.it/rwspkv,582,i‚Äôve heard a lot of people complaining about online school for a week and having to get tested which just got changed so you can get all tests on campus land i just wanted to provide a little perspective on the current situation,i don‚Äôt think people realize just how bad covid is in champaign urbana right now like it is worse now than it has been at any point in the pandemic at least from a healthcare perspective for anecdotal evidence i have a couple friends who work on ambulances in cu and a lot of their calls are for covid more now than ever before according to them one of my family members works in convenient cares in cu a few different ones and during their last shift yesterday they texted me ‚Äúwe are getting slammed everyone is coming back positive for covid‚Äù and then they texted me again at 11 pm 15 hours into their 12 hour shift ‚Äújust heading home now‚Äù i work in an emergency department in urbana we are absolutely slammed we are inventing new hallway bed spots to fit all the patients bc covid and icu holds are taking up the actual rooms we often have multiple icu holds in the ed for some perspective on what that means the intensive care unit or the icu is very full due largely to covid so when someone comes into the ed for an emergency and needs to be admitted to the icu for any reason they can‚Äôt get a spot and are held in the ed an icu patient generally needs a oneonone nurse while most ed patients are treated by a nurse also treating 23 other people so every icu hold prevents us from being able to treat 23 people if we have 3 icu holds we can treat not just 3 fewer people but nine fewer people we are putting chest tubes in people in their 20s and intubating people left and right for nonanecdotal evidence during the last week of 2021 there were 3388 active covid cases in champaign county that we know of that is 1268 more than the week before the report for this week has not come out to make matters worse in the hospital system i work in there have been 212 new covid employees in the past week so we are understaffed as well note hospitalizations are largely the unvaccinated people as of dec 27 80 of the 142 covid hospitalized patients are unvaccinated and 86 of the 30 icu patients are unvaccinated these are just the numbers for the hospital system i work in definitely not all covid hospitalizations in champaign county however that‚Äôs still 27 vaccinated hospitalizations and 4 vaccinated icu patients that‚Äôs not nothing i‚Äôm not saying all this to scare people i just think we‚Äôve become so numb seeing all the deaths and craziness especially in big cities like new york but we had honestly not reached that level in champaign county and this is the closest we have gotten to that so far during this pandemic we‚Äôre lucky this happened after the vaccine was widely available i cannot imagine what it would have been like before but just please think about this when thinking about what choices to make when coming back to campus and when being angry about the week of online schoolingtesting we are going to need to work together and be cautious when coming back to campus if we want to have a remotely no pun intended normal semester edit formatting kept getting weird text boxes,COVID-19,0.35244999999999993

2018-03-23 15:44:38,https://redd.it/86nzbe,524,as a 4th year ece student uiuc has completely scammed me,one of my most vivid childhood memories was riding on a train i still remember that particular trip boarding finding the sleeping space i‚Äôd share with my mother my heart pumping with excitement as the throttle of the engine began the steel walls of our cabin shook slowly but surely we left the light of the train station and then there was nothing to see in the outdoor darkness except for the moon surrounded by a halo of softly lit clouds the rocking of the train lulled me to sleep that night in the morning the same rhythmic rocking woke me the city i knew was gone by then outside was nothing except borderless grasslands that moment i felt that i belonged ‚Äì in the train to no geographical location in particular but to everywhere since then i have dreamed of becoming an engineer i want to be the one driving the train and bringing smiles to peoples‚Äô faces just like the engineer of that train did for me fast forward 12 years i was accepted into uiuc‚Äôs acclaimed ece program i was overjoyed there was something nostalgic about mechanical engineering the organic throttling of the steam engine but i knew society was ready to move on to sleek bulletnoses and sterile electric motors and automated announcers‚Äô voices society wanted electric and computer engineers during my first semesters at uiuc i didn‚Äôt really get to take courses in ece most of my classes were just basics like physics and math the only mention of engineering during my first year came during a cs lecture where the professor used train cabins to explain doubly linked lists my second year i learned about circuits and electromagnetics no doubt important topics especially with the rising popularity of maglev technology some course subjects were very difficult for me to grasp but in the end through grit i managed to maintain a 36 gpa it was not until fall semester senior year when i realized something seemed off it was in my quantum electronics class the class barely had anything to do with engineering even moreso than my previous classes i was almost done with college at this point yet had never even set foot in a train none of my classes directly mentioned them i went to the counselor‚Äôs office in eceb and talked about how much i appreciated the classes building up my fundamentals but disliked never getting to the actual meat of engineering the counselor forgot her name told me that uiuc‚Äôs ece program didn‚Äôt cover actual traindriving she told me that engineering didnt mean the same thing as driving trains she said it without shame inside i broke i walked briskly out of the counselor‚Äôs office tears streaming down my face i did not pour my energy and time into this program for the past three years to hear something like that i headed back to my apartment sank into bed and slept because i didn‚Äôt know what else i could do it took a long time for me to recover emotionally i think i‚Äôm in a slightly better place now i‚Äôve applied to a graduate electrical engineering program elsewhere and will be joining a group researching highspeed bus architectures i can‚Äôt quite understand their publications yet and i‚Äôm still mostly interested in trains but working with busses will be closer to traindriving than anything uiuc had to offer me for anyone else in the uiuc ece program who‚Äôs had their dreams dashed like me i send you my deepest sympathies,Quality Content,0.6939799999999999

2020-11-16 20:00:37,https://redd.it/jvkb6t,487,uiuc being investigated for antisemitism thoughts as a jewish student,apparently following a student complain of widespread antisemitic practices and administrative inaction the department of education will be investigating the university of illinois for antisemitism httpswwwinsidehigheredcomnews20201026jewishstudentsuniversityillinoisallegeantisemiticenvironment see that doesnt track right with me look swastikas have been thrown up in different places and thats shit but the administration has taken reasonable steps against that what these students are complaining about is political action against israel political action that i support theres a friend of mine from high school who is without a doubt in the top five for smartest people ive ever met based on the raw speed at which her brain worked shes jewish very jewish and in fact is doing her undergrad in judaic studies did a birthright trip i got into a discussion with her about american support for israel and she basically said that i must have been brainwashed by antisemitic propaganda in order to disagree with israel and that made me sad because here is this brilliant young woman liberal as can be claiming that everything antiisraeli must be fake news or is offset by how israel sometimes does free heart surgeries for palestinians or something i am a jew like my father and my mother before me i was made bar mitzvah next to the western wall in israel wearing my grandfathers tallis i keep my dairy from my meat i do not eat pork and i have a tendency to make remarks in yiddish i am related by both blood and marriage to survivors of the holocaust who i have met and spoken to about their experience and furthermore i believe that israel as a state should exist but this shit thats going on now its wrong there is an international power with major influence in the levant that is using its superior military and economic backing to fuck over the native population and drive them from their homes all the while justifying the actions to themselves in the name of self defense and domestic security that was what the romans did to us two thousand years ago and we were bitter about it that entire time but suddenly we get our own country fresh from the horrors that can be inflicted when major powers wish to bully those with less influence and within a hundred years were doing to same to the palestinians i am a jew like my father and mother before me and that means that as a jew it befits me not to simply go along with what people tell me i should be but rather to try and fashion myself in the style of the jews that make me proud to be jewish and none of those are benjamin netanyahu they are people like abraham heschel who marched with mlk and moishe ben maimon who would continue working on shabbos if it meant he could treat more patients in his role as a physician regardless of their religion or status so when these students want to wholly conflate antiisraeli political sentiments with antisemitism what theyre really saying is if youre not rabidly in support of a country that engages in the indefensible youre not really a jew its underhanded and its fuckery of a high order so i say fuck em any jew that would rather support israels actions than give some sympathy to the palestinians has never really gotten what they shouldve out of pesach and from purim i do not believe in any way that the university of illinois is especially antisemitic given their track record of effectively and quickly denouncing and taking actions against legitimate antisemitic events that have occurred and believe that a senate resolution promoting a boycott of israeli products is not only non antisemitic but is basically wholly decent ◊ë÷º÷∏◊®◊ï÷º◊ö÷∞ ◊ê÷∑◊™÷º÷∏◊î ◊ô÷∞◊ô÷∏ ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷µ◊ô◊†◊ï÷º ◊û÷∂◊ú÷∂◊ö÷∞ ◊î÷∏◊¢◊ï÷π◊ú÷∏◊ù ◊©◊Å÷∂◊î÷∂◊ó÷±◊ô÷∏◊†◊ï÷º ◊ï÷∞◊ß÷¥◊ô÷º÷∞◊û÷∏◊†◊ï÷º ◊ï÷∞◊î÷¥◊í÷º÷¥◊ô◊¢÷∏◊†◊ï÷º ◊ú÷∑◊ñ÷º÷∞◊û÷∑◊ü ◊î÷∑◊ñ÷º÷∂◊î blessed be thou the lord our god ruler of the universe who has kept us and preserved us and brought us to this time,Social,0.69342

or public health fess up they will absolutely need to know where you were and when so they can warn others who may have also been there and do what is called contact tracing this is how outbreaks are quashed lying just increases the chances that school will be cancelled more people will get sick and some might die if you are not called by the university or public health call them there is a

that you might not remember name names again you will not get in trouble julie pryde public health director is cool went through the aids crisis in the 80s90s and is well aware that punitive measures and shaming just make contact tracing harder everybody wants to beat this thing back and that will not happen if they make everyone feel like shit and want to hide step three quarantine yourself immediatelyhttpswwwdphillinoisgovcovid19communityguidancehomequarantineguidance if you have a roommates warn them it is extremely not cool to expose someone whose life is in your hands do not go to class do not go out and mingle do not go out to eat do not get on a bus or call an uber do not go sit out in your shared living room to watch tv do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars no not even if that cute chick from that night texts for a 2am bootie call with emojis you are grounded for at least the next ten days if you test positive 14 if you do not nor show symptoms thank your lucky stars if this is the worst thing that happens to you if you are the roommate of someone who has done this see this pagehttpscovid19illinoiseduhealthandsupportquarantineandisolation for what you should do to keep yourself safe if you share the room and were there all night breathing the same air you should probably also quarantine to be safe make the exposee pay for the contactless delivery you will be enjoying for the next ten days dont be too hard on them they are likely freaking out and scared too step four do not immediately run to get tested you will likely not show up as positive yet it will likely take 34 days to test positive that is how long you are stuck alone in your room it does not mean you are not infectious treat yourself like the potential typhoid mary you are and keep your potentially plagueridden ass to home caveat to step four if you did not get tested upon arrival before you decided to go out and party go in the bathroom look in the mirror and slap yourself really hard for me you dumb selfish fuck then call the osf number above again that is 8336735669 they will tell you what to do it will likely be go get tested immediately at this spot and well let them know youre coming step five monitor yourself for symptoms every dayhttpscovid19illinoiseduhealthandsupportbasicpersonalactions osf will likely send you a kit take your temperature but dont think no temp means youre out of the woods up to 40 of people dont ever develop a temperature however a lot of people do develop severe diarrhea this is not on the list of symptoms probably because its so commonly caused by other things like food poisoning and kind of gross by severe i mean severe like you are afraid to leave the toilet severe you think you have dysentery severe you do not remember eating that severe if this happens you either have it or ate something bad in your drunken stupor either way warn anyone else to not use that bathroom if you have a communal one try and clean it up as best you can then call osf again the number is 8336735669 step six you wait take classes if you feel up to it online if you start feeling ill call osf with your symptoms once youve been tested once and assuming it comes back negative you are not out of the woods keep monitoring yourself for symptoms call osf 8336735669 if you start to feel bad roommates monitor your sick dumb housemate make sure they are alive every day strokes and heart attacks have been known to happen yes even in otherwise healthy young people dont assume theyre just ignoring you or sleeping in after 10 days you should get tested again if you get another negative test you are likely in the clear hold out for 14 days just in case if you possibly can i believe up to 21 days postexposure is the longest anyones gone before showing symptomstesting positive but that is rare however if you feel ill even after youve been cleared you should probably call osf once again 8336735669 just to be sure what happens if i test positive it depends seriously some people shed virus like a husky sheds furhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvhiqar93mey and never feel a thing some people completely lose their sense of smell and taste this is a telltale symptom some people drop dead of strokes or heart attacks it seems to cause a lot of blood clots kind of like the opposite of ebola most people feel anywhere from bad coldflu to jesus christ i think i just coughed up a piece of my lungbroke a rib kill me now some people recover without incident some people it lingers for months with seeming relapses of fevers aches coughing fuzzy headed thinking google covid brain myocarditis etc its basically a crap shoot which is why everyone is always screaming about wearing a mask and social distancing regardless the quarantine clock resets you are now in quarantine for the next 10 days anyone in your house who has been exposed to you is quarantined for 14 you should not leave your residenceisolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by cuphd important note for potentially infected and roommates thereof if you start to feel really bad like seriously ill you need to call 911 do not fuck around with this if like half your face goes numb or you lose the ability to move one side of your body or a limb or you suddenly develop a crushing blinding headache or chest pain or lose the ability to take a deep breath your lips turn blue or your extremities cold youre suddenly completely exhausted and unable to think roommates if the potential infected person suddenly starts acting weird slurring words seems out of it is unable to be roused their face droops on one side or they suddenly fall to the ground or start gasping for air call 911 immediately tell them youyour roommate may have covid and what happened i was not kidding about strokes and heart attacks once youve tested negative twice youre considered recovered yes even if you still feel like utter shit you at least cant get anyone else sick go to mckinley and get an antibody test its a blood draw to gain the coveted green screen on your safer illinois app note the green screen is only good for four days same as the orange screen they are working on a way to signify someone whos had it and recovered as some people continue to test positive for a long time after recovery dont assume you cant get it again its

2021-09-10 10:18:17,https://redd.it/pln3lj,425,my older brother committed suicide four years ago my only remaining sibling my older sister is at risk i need to vent,i am a senior bachelor‚Äôs degreeseeking student typing this at 547 am in my cramped studio apartment since i am currently experiencing insomnia for the second time with possible preliminary symptoms of a severe anxiety disorder of some sort my heart is panging uncontrollably and i have cried five times in a row so far i am not sure why i am typing this right now my father is a schizophrenic my older brother committed suicide my junior year of high school after being diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder my older sister told me three days ago that she thought about committing suicide for the first time if i lose her too the last piece of my heart will be ripped out i don‚Äôt know what kind of person i might change into and i think i will slowly lose my remaining will to live if anyone is reading this i hope that this introduction will enable you to read through my life‚Äôs events because i think i am the only one who has the mental and emotional capacity in my estranged family left potentially to do things of this sort my father and mother were uneducated immigrants from china with the usual backstory of coming to america to ‚Äúseek a better living‚Äù and refuge during the unstable period of mao zedong‚Äôs election shortly after settling they had two children two years apart around 19901992 my older brother and older sister the problem was that the child abuse forced my two siblings to become parentified as early as around the 3rd to 5th grade of elementary school my older brother bore the burden of stabilizing the family during this extremely vulnerable age such as learning to pay overdue house bills mediating my parent‚Äôs verbal arguments witnessing my father punching my mother in the face being forced to explain issues to police officers due to my parents‚Äô language barriers and further things that children of that age should never bear witness nor be forced to do i was born on september 27 1999 this continued to worsen and worsen until my father‚Äôs schizophrenia manifested to its full extent for the first time when i was in preschool all i vaguely remember was my father during a manic episode destroying the entire house breaking apart every piece of furniture ripping the doors apart etc my grandmother crying in fear she was living within our basement at the time and a blur in which my older brother carried me in his arms outside to protect me my mother and my older sister due to the instability of my memories at the time as i was far too young my older sister has always told me time and again how my older brother confronted my father to protect us only for my father to say ‚Äúyou are not my son‚Äù to him this was the tipping point my father was hospitalized time and time again whenever his prodromal period would end all throughout this elementaryschool phase for my siblings and myself my mother was always the sole breadwinner and she would work multiple part time jobs on and off such as in candymanufacturing factories or as an assembly worker for a trafficlight production company a job she has held for about two decades and currently has now she is a hard worker unfortunately sometimes that is not enough i love her and care for her hell i even loved and cared for my father to an extent but there are times where i inevitably wish she had the capability to divorce my father take her children and run away at this time my brother graduated and attended whitney young magnet high school my sister attended jones college prep and i worked my way up to the eighth grade in a uselessly disgustingly prejudiced ‚Äúgifted program‚Äù i was forcibly assigned to by the school i believe that my brain subconsciously disables and blurs memories of this period as a selfdefense mechanism but there was probably continuous physical abuse emotional abuse and neglect of the sort mentioned prior however for this period it would also include the deterioration of my older brother‚Äôs mental health he would soon develop multiple different anxiety disorders he never obtained a professional diagnosis at this time but i am using my own observations to best explain what i witnessed he became obsessed with gaming as an extremely detrimental coping mechanism and would play upwards to 12 hours a day or more while also quickly becoming angered whenever provoked this anger would soon turn into something along the lines of intermittent explosive disorder as a psychology major i always hate assigning disorders loosely with criteria but i must do this for the sake of befitting synopsis and succinctness once my brother and sister graduated they then went to college at uiuc where before they left they comforted me as i cried despite being in eighth grade i don‚Äôt know why i cried i like to think it was because i would miss them but perhaps there was also fear reluctance and the beginning of my abandonment issues while they were gone to uiuc i successfully entered whitney young also i know that this is a horrible mentality but i felt that it was my responsibility as the youngest child who bore ‚Äúthe least trauma‚Äù to therefore mediate my two parents while my older siblings were busy attempting to forge their own lives despite our abused upbringing what i didn‚Äôt know was that behind the scenes my older brother‚Äôs mental state was still worsening while my older sister had to ironically bear another form of abuse from him while somehow maintaining her own sanity and grades my brother obviously graduated first with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in economics but when he returned he immediately began to experience a period of dissociation while trying his best to fix himself jumping from parttime job to parttime job until he couldn‚Äôt endure it anymore he eventually destroyed the home punching holes in the doorwall etc just as our father did and i blamed him for it i hated him at the time i would run away to seek refuge at the local park in the local library or even camp inside the 24hours cvs pharmacy every day after high school since i was fearful of seeing my own older brother when i inevitably had to return home late at night i would try my best to mediate between my brother and father since my father would trigger his episodes i tried my best to handle everything since i wanted my sister to fully focus on herself her education and for her to at least have the ability to finish her degree and focus on her own life with temporary relief from our living hell at the time but soon after my brother said he wanted to kill himself i couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and broke down one night when i had a video call with my older sister she was forced to come back and forth between college and home multiple times to help with interventions once my sister graduated with her bachelor‚Äôs in food science and human nutrition my brother tried his best to stabilize the three of us began to get together at the local library to help research and contact apartments to quickly move our mother out and try to forge our own lives and fix everything for our family eventually we successfully convinced and moved our mom out then my sister moved out after my father broke her last straw by ‚Äúdisowning her‚Äù despite her leaving of her own accord technically during his prodromal stage then it was just me my older brother and father a few weeks later my older brother looked me in the eyes with a distraught expression that i can still somehow vividly remember even now so i put on my most assured but fake smile and told him that everything would be okay i told him that he could leave too i said that i could handle our father since as the youngest child our dad never really did and would not do anything to me so far it might seem like i hated my older brother but no i do still love him even now while he is gone from this world already fuck tears are falling down uncontrollably now already again fuck my brother mother and sister pitched together to move into an apartment closer to where i was currently living alone with my father i would spend the days performing chores to help my mentally unsound father going to a tutoring gig concentrating on ap classes and inevitably visiting my siblingsmother without letting my father know every month or so this continued until my junior year of highschool i woke up with a call from my older sister one day she didn‚Äôt tell me what was wrong but insisted that i needed to come see her and our mother my heart was palpitating when i ran to the bus stop everyone in the bus stared at me as if i was an insane person as i kept trying to speak to myself to calm down i was in denial i was hopeful i kept making excuses such as how my sister would have told me outright if what i was thinking was truly the case i broke down immediately when i found out he committed suicide by hanging in the basement of their apartment what was worse was how he attempted to see me one last time the night before but i was gone tutoring late the last time i had seen him was a month before his fucking suicide where he asked awkwardly if i could hug him our family has never shown each other true affection so i brushed it off like a fucking idiot why didn‚Äôt i do so and then take a walk to the park like we used to do when i was young before things went to shit after he committed suicide i mustered my courage and went with my older sister to confront our father about what happened my sister also a hard worker was struggling and working a job three hours away in commute while facing her own crises so after our father seemingly broke down but recovered she left me back alone with him for the next several days however my father‚Äôs condition again was triggered and worsened he began to experience tics perseveration and other schizophrenic symptomatology since it was worsening my sister was forced to come back from her work to stay overnight to keep me safe the next day she told me to stay put as she confronted him to find that he had been cutting himself on the wrists that night before running upstairs and saying that we had to leave my father ran after us stating that he and i should die together to ‚Äújoin my older brother‚Äù we went to the police station temporarily to see if he would follow us in before carefully taking the train to my high school the more i explain this the more i feel numb i am elongating this far too much i know but my emotions are turbulent and i need to vent my sister and i explained everything to all the counselors there who then contacted dcfs where i eventually after endless court cases became a ward of the state we obtained a restraining order while being forced to abandon our father and his side of the family for our own safety we moved far away with our mother to seek refuge and try to recover ourselves since i shortly entered uiuc my older sister was forced to handle the funeral arrangements arguments with my slightly abusive mother verbal abuse is nevertheless abuse and her attempts to find another job unfortunately she has been unemployed for almost six years four years were wasted fixing things for this broken family the other two years were her hard work and efforts to find new skills such as successfully obtaining certification from a uiux academy since she realized how she hated dietetics my sister is the most resilient pragmatic and capable person i know but two years of job interviewers turning her down have hurt her she‚Äôs tried her best it‚Äôs either she explains the truth behind her unemployment gap to employers or she doesn‚Äôt if she does tell the truth what kind of employers would want someone with this type of fucked up background and upbringing if she doesn‚Äôt tell the truth how can she possibly keep putting up a fake face and smile that destroys her mental health further three days ago my mother was crying as she told my sister that we are going to be in thousands of dollars of debt and potentially tens of thousands of dollars of debt in the future due to building code violations in the old house with endless traumatic memories that my father has resided in the past two years my mother‚Äôs name is still on the deed since she never divorced our father out of both fear and lack of education he has apparently been hoarding trash around the entire sidewalk and destroying the property this entire time likely due to his condition the court has docket photos that have made this evident this debt has implicated us obviously since her name is on the deed my mother in her desperation attempted to reconnect and call one of our relatives we trust my older cousin to finally take matters into her own hands and get a divorce with my father this was already an insane risk for obvious reasons and one of our final options and last resort the call back was gaslighting stating that my mother should come back and be with my father that my older sister is an adult and should know how to take care of herself and that i should go back to apologize to my father my own father attempted to potentially murder me and i also lost my older brother due to complications with him none of them ever helped my family throughout every single one of my fathers or brothers episodes in fact i remember my father handing one of my cousins his cash from his wallet during an instance in which his symptoms flared up one time in which they didn‚Äôt even pause as they took his money without question how dare they how dare they have the gall to tell us what to do when so much has been practically taken and lost from us right now i am stuck here in college while my sister is about to meet with our last hope a lawyer to consult about whether ‚Äúquit claim deeds‚Äù require the grantee‚Äôs signature so that hopefully we can just cut off the property and future debt payments without needing to meet our father physically obviously my mother has to change her phone number also to avoid being potentially harassed stalked or even worse by our father as my sister and i suspected but hoped would not be the case our relatives on our father‚Äôs side are cut off from our lives now my sister broke down in a call with me last night saying that she doesn‚Äôt know how much more she can take that she feels stuck but knows she has to live and keep surviving for my own sake she knows this but she told me that she had to let me know that she thought of suicide for the first time uncontrollably my sister and i have almost no support systems my sister and i have no close relationships with any relatives my sister has no friends and has estranged herself from all coworkers the past eight years for the reasons i stated above our fortitude and attempts to even live‚Ä¶ to live happily‚Ä¶ and to live normally have taken a toll over time there is only so much resilience a person can have no matter how much we attempt to escape our past issues always come up that implicate us to remind us that we will never be able to have actual happiness i have witnessed too much that has whittled away my faith and will to live slowly by no means am i extrapolating this to every policeman but i have witnessed officers laughing at my father‚Äôs manic episode and abandoning the premises as the three children cried i have witnessed the failure of this country‚Äôs mental healthcare system when my brother and father were hospitalized multiple times but released without proper treatment as they signed themselves out by no means am i fully aware of our mental healthcare policies but what i do know is that it did not help avoid this current situation when i was young i witnessed my sister‚Äôs high school ‚Äúfriends‚Äù laugh at her issues and say that they didn‚Äôt believe her that even if the issues were real they couldn‚Äôt do anything to help i have witnessed abandonment by my relatives abandonment by my own family at times but i forgive them the suicide of my brother who was forced to face facets of abuse and adulthood ever since he was only fucking eight years old the struggles and attempts to live by my sister and the agingsuffering of my mother from losing her firstborn by suicide i have visited three therapists one by reaching out to my own caseworker before i ‚Äúexited‚Äù the dcfs system one of my own volitionsearch near my home and one here on campus after attempting to make an appointment three times in a row all three would look in disbelief as i divulged everything while unintentionally having me brush over my issues via generalizing questionscommentary i know they probably meant well and perhaps i have confirmation biases of my own perhaps i simply need to keep reaching out however none have helped nor provided tangible resourcessuggestions i have witnessed some school faculty i will not disclose names for obvious reasons in my high school purposefully avoid me simply on the basis of my problems and struggles once it became known one of them who helped comfort me at the crisis of my dad‚Äôs breakdown also didn‚Äôt say anything and went the other direction with a fearful expression when i encountered them in the hallway coincidentally weeks later i can‚Äôt forget that moment for some reason my sister always would laugh in selfridicule saying that technically not once has our family ever had a happy memory i would argue that us three siblings did have memories that i still try to cling onto but i can‚Äôt help but cry sometimes when i remember how she told me that she can‚Äôt actually remember some of them whether it is due to her trauma or some other sort of mental facet i don‚Äôt know what to do i don‚Äôt i can‚Äôt anymore maybe some part of me still has an inkling of hope left that allows me to subsist today i will wait for my sister to convey information about the lawyer if worse comes to worst i need to hurry and graduate so i can move out with my sister i also hope that i can keep contact and help my mother out simultaneously if the issue is resolvable but i am distraught right now my sister and i always wanted us three siblings to one day just live together and try to help lift each other back on our feet i don‚Äôt want to abandon that dream we had when young i don‚Äôt want to lose her too i realized that i haven‚Äôt valued enough time havent spent enough experiences and truly have not taken what i have remaining for granted prior to this point if you have read to this point thank you i want to at least leave some remembrance even if anonymously perhaps for my older brother ive lost perhaps for my own sake or to simply keep myself from deteriorating further at this moment i know that this is probably futile and that i am probably only typing this to temporarily either preserve my sanity or give myself solace i think i am a resilient person but to a detriment maybe i will later regret making this post or writing this to begin with my family has always been fearful and distrustful of divulging any of our history i am tired of it being kept inside me i probably will try to reach out for the first time and reveal everything for the first time to the only few individuals i might be able to trust the truth is however i am always afraid to reach out i still dont even know why i am typing this right now for some reason the rational or maybe hopeful side of me is saying to stop typing and delete this the rational side of me is saying that my resilient sister will be fine and that she will recover just like the times before when she broke down the tens of times before that maybe i will just laugh at what i am doing right now in the future if things somehow work out but no i know that is wrong and that i should not be ashamed nor scared to reveal my past anymore that is part of the problem in my way of thinking in my familys way of thinking that may have led to this point regardless again to anyone who somehow has taken the time to listen thank you for hearing me
