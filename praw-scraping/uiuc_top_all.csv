2021-11-15 22:15:15,https://redd.it/quz6if,1593,im tired of the fetishization of cs majors,the females on this campus are out of control the first time i ate lunch wearing my grainger cs shirt with fully covered legs mind you i had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me like i would know how to talk to a girl i quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool why shame me for being smart anyway that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and i am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me ive taken to moving all the other chairs at tables i sit at to other tables but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last mp girl i dont struggle with mps im a cs major not csx after making it markedly clear that i did not in fact want to copulate in the isr bathroom she finally left me alone but i wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because i am enrolled in the hardest program on campus which was not difficult for me to get into by the way the worst are when students from nontechnical majors talk to me well be having a nice platonic conversation when they inevitably ask the fateful question whats your major as soon as i say those two magnificent letters i see their whole demeanor change the doe eyes the flushed cheeks the jiggling cleavage what makes an art major think they have a chance with me faa and grainger are on whole different planes of existence im not about to impregnate somebody that paints happy little trees for work you may think im just remarkably handsome which i am but my attractive acquaintances in ece theyre not smart enough to be friends but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures females see me as an object and a genius when really im so much more im top 100 in the world in destiny 2 my gray shirt shouldnt reduce me to a bag of meat if you want my heart you have to grind with me raid with me join my clan and most of all watch rick and morty with me and understand it no fake fans that shout pickle rick like its some kind of joke when its really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3 not that i cried if you want somebody for cheap sex the ece majors are right there i dont blame you for avoiding cs x though stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control i didnt want to be born a super genius hell sometimes i wish i was an ece major moving through the world in ignorant bliss but i have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next facebook seductively touching grainger bob isnt going to make me want to get with you come back in a morty costume code a y combinator or implement djikstras recursively and then well talk
2023-12-15 21:20:02,https://redd.it/18jhx57,1555,i lied to my student ta,so i’m a ta and told my student who was taking a test i needed to go to the bathroom and that i’d be right back she came into the bathroom and almost saw me doing a line off the little counter in front of the mirror sometimes taing just be like that but i brushed it away before she saw rip she was on her phone though and honestly i’m not sure what she saw or if she’s just looking up answers but i said she has to get a fair violation for cheating afterwards in a very formal email i just don’t want to be caught aita should i come clean
2021-02-17 19:41:05,https://redd.it/lmajmi,1550,my name is ivor thank you all for the support heres what i want to say,to my fellow graduate researchers professors undergraduate students first of all i want to thank all the students for their incredible support in the last few days i want to thank everyone on the geo team for all the work done on my behalf and i want to thank all the professors and staff members who went out of their ways to help me thank you all very much now your voices are heard on february 16th dean justin brown informed me that the disciplinary committee modified my punishments to 1 dismissal held in abeyance conduct probation 2 two 1000words essays and 3 25hour community service i intend to accept the punishment this is not the best result one can hope for but it is something i can swallow in the last few days i have read and heard many stories of how the universitys inconsiderate policies and disciplinary actions affected students lives since my case is now out in the open and since i have 18000 signatures on my petition it is my responsibility to step up and say something to the universitys administration certainly i do not claim to represent anyone but myself and what i am about to propose is nothing but a piece of personal opinion but i do hope it can stimulate widespread discussions among students and faculty members with sufficient debates and discussions it is my hope that we could present our collective opinion to the university administration to call for a more transparent and humane covid19 policy proposal 1 disciplinary sanctions should be nuanced tiered and educational in nature in response to reported noncompliance the covid19 response team should 1 on first report send a written personal notice to remind the student of his or her alleged noncompliance to inform the student of detailed covid19 policies and to offer help if the student has special conditions preventing him or her from participating in covid19 testing program 2 on second report the student should expect to have an informal meeting with the covid19 response team to discuss his or her alleged noncompliance during the meeting the student should be informed clearly of the consequence of further noncompliance 3 formal procedure of student disciplinary process will start on the third report 2 severity of disciplinary sanctions should depend primarily on the impact of the alleged noncompliance medicalpublichealth experts from mckinley or college of medicine should assess the impact of the alleged noncompliance the assessment criterion should be made open and transparent the student disciplinary office should not be involved in this assessment process 3 undergraduate who missed a test should be notified through safer illinois app one day after a missed test the student shall see a warning message in the app and shall be denied access to campus buildings the warning message should contain contact information of covid19 response team in order to provide the student with an opportunity to resolve his or her situation two days after a missed test the same message shall be repeated to the student three days after a missed test the noncompliance should be reported to the covid19 response team 4 university covid19 policies should treat graduate researchers the same way as faculty members and staff this includes an automatic exemption from testing if the graduate researcher is 100 remote this university is blessed with the best professors and the best students hence the administrators have a duty of care especially in the time of upheaval and uncertainty as my professors have written in their letter of support uiuc has distinguished itself as a national leader in controlling covid19 strict enforcement of student conduct violations has been an essential element of this success but it is equally important that the university maintains its commitment to a just and nuanced student conduct system in which the punishment fits the violation the universitys reputation regarding the fairness with which it arbitrates the student conduct violations will last far longer than the current pandemic thank you all very much ivor

the mail today sorry for the crappy cell phone picture ill reproduce the majority of it in my response below here is a link to the letter i receivedhttpimgurcomaoyast dear mr long first please be advised that my email address is murphmurphcc you have it wrong below i respond to each point of your email in detail be advised that im quickly retyping your words as i go and thus and omissions or typographical errors are a mistake please supply me with a proper electronic copy of further correspondence it is my clients understanding that you are the moderator of this thread i am one of several moderators and many reddit admins who have the ability to interact with the postings on ruiuc and not only are you personally publishing false and libelous information i dont believe i am itd be helpful if you could respond with the specifics on this accusation i dont intend to be libelous but you are also allowing false and libelous posting about my clients business operations despite clear knowledge on your part that the materials are untruthful i have no clear knowledge that anything posted is libelous and as far as i know i am under no legal obligation to prevent these postings if you wish to have those postings modified please address your letters to reddit not myself i believe strongly in allowing people to post their opinions and try to only remove content if it is violating the community guidelines it is my understanding that you have no personal experience to form as a basis to make the assertions that you have published because you have never been a customer of suburban express with a negative experience this is false ive had personal negative experiences with suburban expresss both as a customer and not it is my understanding that whenever anyone attempts to post something that either defends or makes positive reference to suburban express you take the extraordinary step of removing that information actually there are many positive postings that have not been removed i have even used my moderation ability to whitelist positive postings by frequent members of the community i have only removed postings that were either spam such as someone creating multiple accounts violating the community guidelines posting personal information harassing etc or otherwise unsuitable for the content of the subreddit ruiuc i do not claim to be perfect though and determining which posts are made by legitimate users is not something i can do with 100 accuracy this exercise of control over the reddit postings by you are clearly done for no other purpose than to harm the business interest of my client the primary goal of my posting and action is to further the discussion and community of ruiuc i also aim to prevent the many readers and students who get their information from ruiuc from being targeted by lawsuits you further claim to know that some andor all of the posts which are negative about suburban express are being made by someone at suburban express however i doubt that you have any actual proof of your thoughts i will assume that you meant postive instead of negative since surely subex wouldnt be insulting itself i dont have any proof however i have a strong personal belief and many of the users agree with me there probably is such proof however which would only come to light if this proceeds to litigation a counterclaim of harassment would reveal the ip logs during discovery you can ask your client if that would be a good thing or a bad thing for him the fact that you are taking these actions to remove anything which might counterbalance the negativity expressed against suburban express evidences your intent to maintain this reddit thread to interfere with and harm the business interests of suburban express as discussed that is not what im doing so no it doesnt that is not my intent my client also takes issue with a heading on your thread where you inform people dont ride suburban express they are likely to sue you have terrible reviews and also this based upon the ridership of suburban express though this year and the year of 2012 the percentage of customers who are sued for violating the terms and conditions is so minuscule as to make your claims about being sued false and this fact is also true relative to your claim about terrible reviews peoria charter has sued none of its passengers i dont know of any other local bus company that has over a hundred lawsuits comparatively is thus very likely if youre trying to argue that 155 stars is not terrible reviews than you need to visit internet review sites more often that is clearly bad i stand by these claims and they will remain up until i see a serious change in the behavior of your client and receive a public apology for his actions accordingly if you do not take corrective action to remedy the damages from your false and libelous postings by removing the items at issue by april 27 2013 suburban express has authorized the pursuit of legal actions against you as a result of your conduct again im not sure exactly which postings you consider libelous please be specific in the future so we can discuss the individual assertions within them as far as i can see your client has no legal ground to stand on is probably guilty of harassment and should be ashamed of his actions i welcome your response id also encourage you to make an account on reddit if you do not already have one and to visit the uiuc subreddit you could even do a ama style posting short for ask me anything im sure many of our community members would love to ask questions about what its like to be a lawyer and what its like to represent suburban express valediction murph edit switched to a version without my personal information in it stop pming me about that edit

2020-01-22 23:48:49,https://redd.it/esouvt,747,maybe ill get fired but fuck housing,hey guys its your friendly neighborhood ra here i know the rules say no throwaways but mods hear me out im posting on a throwaway so i dont lose my job but i think this is important for everyone to read i have been loyally employed to university housing since my sophomore year of college and every single semester they find a new way to piss me off but this semester they really went above and beyond im writing this not only because im pissed off but because i feel as though the other students of this university should know what is going on in the background because theyre not just wasting my money theyre wasting yours too so lets begin with last friday last friday all of the ras and mas were required to come back a full day earlier from our winter break so that we could attend a training on antisemitism for those of you who dont remember last semester there was a major controversy in which an ma made a presentation that was horribly misconstrued as antisemitic and for some reason robert j jones our lord and savior decided he needed to take action on this matter which he was incredibly misinformed about so he hired two presenters from the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago to come speak to us however had he taken the time to vet his sources or at least perform a very simple google search he would know that this particular group has in the past few years been at the center of some major protests mostly by other jewish people who are not in support of the jufs tendency to donate and fund antiislam and antiarabic hate groups in fact if our illustrious leader chancellor robert j jones takes some time away from his busy schedule of writing massmails to read this ive found a link right here found from said simple google searchhttpschicagomonitorcom201703chicagojewishactiviststelljewishunitedfundstopfundingantimuslimhategroups why did jones hire someone that so obviously goes against the message of tolerance acceptance and social justice that we strive to promote my guess would be laziness the presenters came and gave less of a training and more of a biased lecture in which we were certainly educated on the problem of antisemitism but we were also bombarded with definitions and explanations that were so obviously biased it was ridiculous any students with dissenting opinions were silenced and ignored when asked about palestinians culture and beliefs specifically regarding selfdetermination the presenters appropriately stated that they were not of that culture and had no authority to speak on it but though he should i doubt our fearless leader chancellor jones is going to call in anyone to represent the students of palestinian identity so i guess to him they just dont matter feel free to correct me if im wrong jonesy im just stating how it looks then comes saturday normally this day of training would be reserved for inhall time in which we would be able to work with our staff on buildingspecific topics and have time to work on our bulletin boards and floor decorations instead housing decided that this semester they would revoke our usual inhall time and replace it with a 7 hour training in which we sat in the same room of the sdrp in the same seats while listening to the same two people give us a lecture on self care from 9am to 430pm they wasted 2 of those hours talking about the exact same socialidentity spiel that ive heard at least 3 times per semester every semester towards the end of the training one of the presenters talked about how she understood that our jobs are hard and being an ra is difficult and stressful and that she knows that we dont get paid enough for what we do we dont get compensated enough for the time and effort we put into this job this was met with thunderous applause from all of the ras and mas in the room only for it to fall flat when the same presenter suggested that an appropriate remedy to this issue is making sure that we selfcare more that night having been deprived of our usual time to work on things myself and most of the other ras in my building were up until 2 am working on bulletin boards and floor decorations before the school year had even started i think my main complaint here is that the university as a whole is so incredibly blind to the needs of its students and deaf to their complaints do you know why we got a 7 hour training on self care it wasnt for us we were taught less about how to self care for ourselves and more how to help others find self care strategies it was so we could teach it to our residents and so we knew how to help our residents work on it because mental health is such a widespread problem not just in university housing but on the campus as a whole mental health is something that not only i struggle with but so do my friends my coworkers my residents my coworkers residents my classmates etc and its not as easy as just going to the counseling center i dont know how many of you have tried lately to get regular support from the campus counseling center but let me tell you its damn near impossible the counseling center is overrun with students all the time you would think that this would be a signal to the university that maybe they need to focus more on the mental health needs of their students but instead they ignore it and put it on their housing staff to solve the problem while some students are slaving away working two jobs just to be able to afford to go here while scraping by in their classes the university decides to hike up the tuition rate the counseling center is always full and counselors are always in demand yet instead of hiring more licensed professionals to help take care of the depressed anxious and in some cases suicidal students they give tim killeen a 100000 bonus for doing such a good job writing the massmails mental health is such an important issue and we have students in the residence halls every single year attempt to take their own lives ive seen a few cases just this last semester and it kills me every time because no one deserves to feel ignored no one deserves to feel forgotten but i feel like the mental health needs of the students on this campus have been forgotten today during our weekly staff meeting we talked about all of the complaints we had and improvements we think needed to be made on the training this year and i made the point that i feel like we are not being heard moreso we are actively being ignored by housing the same way the students of this campus as a whole are being actively ignored by the university they act like they care and they preached to the ras and mas for 7 hour straight about selfcare all the while taking away 7 hours worth of potential selfcare from the very students they lectured they preach tolerance and social justice and then hire the least tolerant association they could find to give us a biased speech on antisemitism i dont know what the solution here is my hopes is that this will piss someone off enough that the administration of the university will read it that someone with power will actually listen or at the very least that maybe if theres enough of us rallying for it maybe we can make some change on this campus because im sick and tired of being ignored by the university im sick and tired of the mental health needs of all of us being forgotten i dont know what needs done but im sick and tired of doing nothing x200b edit thank you for the gold kind stranger for those of you who

thishttpspreviewredditvx8u10ujbde71jpgwidth850formatpjpgautowebps51335d7e0929eb6693a4647150e0b07b8eaeb01d hi my name is megan this picture is of me several years ago in the hospital a day after a heart surgeon had pulled a tumor the size of a stick of butter out of my chest it had been wrapping itself around my airway at the time – i went in thinking i had walking pneumonia and came out with a cancer diagnosis it sucked but i lived but it also took 7 months of aggressive chemo to make sure i lost my hair i felt like crap some days but again i lived so it all worked out i was 37 at the time today i work at grainger library and i’m here to do two things put a human face on someone at risk and make a request i’m asking that you wear masks yes even if you’re vaccinated i know it sucks it also sucks for me – believe me i have the perspective of someone who had to carry around a liter of chemo liquid as it continuously pumped fluid so noxious into my veins that they had to use a chest port to get it there lest it dissolve my flesh so yeah masks do suck – i’m with ya but even though i’m vaccinated the idea of being one of the breakthrough cases and dying on a ventilator sucks even more i didn’t survive cancer to die of a soupedup flu we’ve been here all year – the staff at grainger we were here even before the vaccine was released and if you’re thinking “sure you’re paid to be there” yeah but check the salaries for library civil service sometime while i know i’m lucky to make what i make i know there are folks way worse off than me i’m also not sipping mimosas poolside after work i make enough to have both a playstation and an xbox i didn’t have to choose 😉 but i’m not doing this work because i make the big bucks i’m doing it because i’ve always loved working in libraries i’ve been doing it since i was an undergrad i knew i wasn’t going to be a researcher curing cancer or an engineer figuring out how to make earthquake proof buildings – but i was good at finding stuff for people and maybe i could help someone find the information they needed to cure cancer or make earthquake proof buildings and that philosophy is why the head of the grainger engineering library wanted us to try really hard to make sure we remained open even during the worst of it we wanted you to have as much of that college experience as possible and we wanted to support you in your work i know there are some of you who think this will ruin your college experience – but trust me i also have perspective on that my parents couldn’t afford to house me in a dorm so i lived with them my first two years at college no one wanted to come to my place to hang out i was isolated and unable to connect to almost anyone by the time i was a junior and could afford my own place everyone had grouped up college wasn’t the same for me as it was for everyone on campus i made exactly one college friend i don’t have any fond memories of college other than some of the professors i was able to get classes with i’m not trying to whine i’m fine i’m not unhappy with my life but i know right now today there are students out there in similar situations – due to finances or physical limitations – who are absolutely not ever going to get the chances you have mask or no they are unhappy and wish a mask was the only thing holding them back from having the time of their life not even my graduate school experience was untainted – i still remember the vibe of coming to work at aces one day to see everyone staring at their computer monitors watching cnn that fateful day in september but we all got through that too we carried on and coped in our own ways even so i feel for each and every one of you who has to go through this i too was excited when the mask mandate ended i supervise 10 graduate assistants some of whom will never know what uiuc campus life is like since they were so bummed over the last year they finished the degree in a year and a summer to get it over with i am absolutely in pain on their behalf i hate this is what they got college is expensive a huge time investment and a lot of emotions are tied up into the promise of what the experience could be i get it but i’m still asking you to mask up because it’s not safe yet and maybe you still don’t care – you’re not in a highrisk group sure but that doesn’t mean you can’t get it and spread it and every person on this campus that you come into contact with now has to take that particular risk with you only their odds aren’t as good all these people are here to support your college experience while you get to have it have little say in the matter if you refuse to mask up we have to work to earn a paycheck and pay bills rent put food on the table etc the head of this library is in his 70s there are more than a few folks who work here with comorbidities we’ve all been vaccinated but breakthrough cases happen httpswwwpbsorgnewshourhealthbreakthroughcovidinfectionsshowtheunvaccinatedarenowputtingthevaccinatedatriskhttpswwwpbsorgnewshourhealthbreakthroughcovidinfectionsshowtheunvaccinatedarenowputtingthevaccinatedatrisk – and they are more likely to happen the more you’re exposed delta is scary we’re filled with anxiety our blood pressure is up our mental fatigue is high and we don’t have the option of being 20 anymore but we’re still here we’ve kept at it all through the last year and we’ll keep at it again this year and all we’re asking you to do to help us out is wear a mask maybe i’m biased but i like not dying of covid i like not risking even a terrible horrible no good flu i like being safe if wearing a piece of cloth on my face is the price i have to pay not to have covid wreck my life or the lives of those i work with i’ll do it finally please don’t direct your anger at those asking you to mask up the maskers are probably all vaccinated were just scared people we’re having to mask up again because some folks have been fooled into thinking a virus votes and has political reasoning and those folks are keeping this thing going and making it worse changing covid as it multiplies and mutates in their bodies so that our protection becomes less effective with each iteration saying the masks will never end and this is just one long step in forever is missing the point if everyone got vaccinated or if even enough of us did we’d be back on track to demask help educate yourself and others so they make safe choices thats truly the only way well beat this bastard covid i looked some

2020-05-09 10:18:52,https://redd.it/ggh6ax,648,in hindsight maybe we shouldnt have kept going online,i taught four sections this semester two really large ones personal finance ace240 with 350 and a 2nd 8 week course of 250 respectively and two upper level classes that were meeting in person and now that its over i think i was wrong in march i was an advocate that classes should go on continue march forward lets move online and as my larger ones were online to begin with in fact i railed on the faculty senate when they introduced a proposal to shut it all down but now that its wrapped up heres what happened first privilege is real and rippled almost immediately into performance and assessment some students had access to their parents home offices others shared space with siblings some went home to loving warm places and other very toxic and dangerous ones and it rippled through emails that were really heartbreaking one day in april four emails all students struggling so to try and make it fair i moved due dates from every sunday night to the end of the semester which ended with so many students saying fuck it and giving up in a class of 250 90 students didnt bother with the last few projects that ratio is awful second initially a bump in numbers attending where id usually have 20 show up for class the rest listening to the archive or just not the end of march we were at 30 for awhile but the bump was short lived and by the end of april i had a class with 11 show up 11 out of 250 so i wonder is this semester just an exercise in privilege and how on earth am i supposed to discern who is actually having a hard time and who is full of shit lastly cnc the risk of trying to game a grade and hit a c is the risk of getting it wrong and landing at a high d i use a 200 points grading system 200180 a 179160 b 159140 c etc and so many kids wound up with less than 140 meaning if they went cnc itll be nc which puts me in a tough spot because do you let people turn things in late and once you do what about students who got it all done concluding these are tradeoffs without right answers faculty arent capable of assessing the level of personal tragedy and its unjust to grade on privilege maybe we should have just all gone home and tackled this more thoughtfully in the summer or fall

2021-10-31 16:04:35,https://redd.it/qjyq10,619,four years ago i was hazed by pi kappa alpha and spent three months at carle,when i returned to uiuc i went to the fraternity sorority affairs office where i plead my case x200b nothing was done several days later i was emailed and told the investigation would be underway nothing ever came of it i never gained the courage to approach anyone else about the matter i really was in fear of whatever ramifications were possible and quickly developed ptsd while on campus my sophomore year i visited my palliative care doctor at carle who sent me to a psychiatrist shortly after i was diagnosed with ptsd x200b i dropped out and went on with my life however the hazing that made me spend one month on a ventilator has completely changed me as a person and ive spent the last four years doing a lot of healing x200b if you are a student on campus please report any hazing harassment or abuse that happens to you you are empowering other people when you follow through x200b throwaway account edit thanks everyone for the well wishes and advice i’ve largely moved past this part of my life and don’t wish to dive back into an investigation or lawsuit lawyers are also expensive and i don’t have the means i’ve since moved states started working full time and i’m finishing an associates degree with a cc this fall for those who want to know details of what happened i decided to leave specifics out because that’s not the purpose of my post the purpose of my post was to bring light to the issue using my own experience i will say the hazing was a wide spectrum forced alcohol consumption physical abuse verbal abuse mental abuse and egregious sleep deprivation the sleep deprivation was the worst and my doctors have said was the largest factor of why i ended up in the hospital
2020-11-13 18:30:25,https://redd.it/jts5o6,616,hit my breaking point today,i moved here for grad school in august only a few weeks after my mom got diagnosed with cancer it kills me to be so far away from her a relative called me this morning saying that she was checked in to the hospital and between stressing about school covid and the election i just can’t stop crying not to mention the loneliness of moving during a fucking pandemic i should get up and make myself dinner but it feels impossible i know like a good majority of you don’t care and frankly that is okay i just need somewhere to say it edit i’m very glad to be proven wrong about people not caring the amount of support has also been making me cry but the good kind

2020-06-02 08:30:51,https://redd.it/gv7dnl,592,in defense of this subreddit and the defense of communication,i have been seeing a lot of posts recently that have called out this subreddit saying that by not supporting looting you are not supporting the movement as a black man from a lowincome neighborhood i can understand that feeling of anger even if personally i may not agree with it i do feel like it affects many innocent people business owners shoppers etc and their livelihoods should be taken into consideration too the overall consensus i feel is that the vast majority of people here support equal rights and want to find peaceful ways to do it i would agree with that i feel like there is a problem with carrying a more centrist view on this matter as it makes people who are really passionate about this issue feel like you dont care i just want to remind people that it is okay to feel conflicted it is okay to support the message but not all of methods this is a serious topic and one that is very new to a lot of us emotions are high and people are rightfully angry and people show that in different ways which could be both beneficial and detrimental to the cause with that being said i want to provide not a counterpoint but an alternate way of thinking about the lootingrioting again i do not think it is a good idea and there are probably a lot of people looting that are not really for the cause i can admit that however imagine the people who are riotingprotesting who feel like this is their only way to send a message i can say that peaceful protestspushing for policies are the best course of action but i also have the benefit of going to college which gave me this opportunity to find a way out of my neighborhood if all goes well postgraduation i can support myself and my family with my career of choice a lot of people in these protests do not feel like they have this opportunity they are fueled by so much anger for injustice for not having a voice for being stuck in a cycle of poverty that their parents and grandparents were in that they feel this is their only way to have a voice is to violently protest if i were in their shoes i would do whatever i can to prevent this issue from becoming another nonissue in two weeks time for the people that say there are healthier more legal ways to show support yes i agree but i want to provide another perspective one of the problems especially in the black community is that there is this emphasis on keeping emotions in a lot of black people including myself were conditioned to not show emotions its a sign of weakness and sadly that is what we did every injustice or pain that we felt we internalized and moved on there is going to come a time where all those emotions come out and you become fueled by it it is the driving force behind everything that you are fighting for and with that that might be some of the motivation behind why people feel justified to loot do i think it is a valid excuse no but i also have had the benefit to better cope with these feelings through therapy and medication from the university i got to talk about these feelings and find alternative healthier ways to cope with it very few people have that benefit now this can open up a whole different discussion on the importance of mental health in impoverished communities but that is a topic for a different day sorry im a psych major i had to bring that side up you might be reading all of this and be thinking i am confused what was the point of all this the point is that there are so many different perspectives on this matter i feel like we all except trolls support the message of ending police brutality but we want to support it in a peaceful way in times like this it is important to hear all perspectives not as an excuse but just to get a better understanding i feel like most of you are willing to listen and i guess i was trying to provide those alternate perspectives just in a more respectful less accusatory way stay safe illini tldr black lives matter edit again thank you all for all the supportdiscussion to the one commenter who said the failure of the education system was the fault of my culture for not valuing hard work and education i am going to pray for you

2022-01-05 11:54:24,https://redd.it/rwspkv,580,i’ve heard a lot of people complaining about online school for a week and having to get tested which just got changed so you can get all tests on campus land i just wanted to provide a little perspective on the current situation,i don’t think people realize just how bad covid is in champaign urbana right now like it is worse now than it has been at any point in the pandemic at least from a healthcare perspective for anecdotal evidence i have a couple friends who work on ambulances in cu and a lot of their calls are for covid more now than ever before according to them one of my family members works in convenient cares in cu a few different ones and during their last shift yesterday they texted me “we are getting slammed everyone is coming back positive for covid” and then they texted me again at 11 pm 15 hours into their 12 hour shift “just heading home now” i work in an emergency department in urbana we are absolutely slammed we are inventing new hallway bed spots to fit all the patients bc covid and icu holds are taking up the actual rooms we often have multiple icu holds in the ed for some perspective on what that means the intensive care unit or the icu is very full due largely to covid so when someone comes into the ed for an emergency and needs to be admitted to the icu for any reason they can’t get a spot and are held in the ed an icu patient generally needs a oneonone nurse while most ed patients are treated by a nurse also treating 23 other people so every icu hold prevents us from being able to treat 23 people if we have 3 icu holds we can treat not just 3 fewer people but nine fewer people we are putting chest tubes in people in their 20s and intubating people left and right for nonanecdotal evidence during the last week of 2021 there were 3388 active covid cases in champaign county that we know of that is 1268 more than the week before the report for this week has not come out to make matters worse in the hospital system i work in there have been 212 new covid employees in the past week so we are understaffed as well note hospitalizations are largely the unvaccinated people as of dec 27 80 of the 142 covid hospitalized patients are unvaccinated and 86 of the 30 icu patients are unvaccinated these are just the numbers for the hospital system i work in definitely not all covid hospitalizations in champaign county however that’s still 27 vaccinated hospitalizations and 4 vaccinated icu patients that’s not nothing i’m not saying all this to scare people i just think we’ve become so numb seeing all the deaths and craziness especially in big cities like new york but we had honestly not reached that level in champaign county and this is the closest we have gotten to that so far during this pandemic we’re lucky this happened after the vaccine was widely available i cannot imagine what it would have been like before but just please think about this when thinking about what choices to make when coming back to campus and when being angry about the week of online schoolingtesting we are going to need to work together and be cautious when coming back to campus if we want to have a remotely no pun intended normal semester edit formatting kept getting weird text boxes

2022-12-28 15:06:07,https://redd.it/zxkzow,580,update on fuck smile student living city of urbana just saved our ass,thank you so much on the response on my previous post i wanted to provide an update to everyone and let you know how smile tried to make us take responsibility for things they are responsible for and how at the end of the day knowing our rights as tenant in the city of urbana saved our ass x200b summary of what happened pipe burst last saturday somewhere on the top floor tenants informed smile but they didnt immediately shut down the fire system water and it leaked for two days flooding about 10 apartments and corridors smile shut down domestic water since saturday and asked tenants to move out multiple units ceilings collapsed and entire units were water soaked with damages to physical items and possible mold growth x200b what smile did when smile asked people to move out they initially said they will cover hotel until wednesday later they said emails that said the tenants have to contact their rental insurances even for some residents like me whose unit was completely damaged they said i have to figure out my own accommodation until the unit is fixed no timeline paying out of pocket for those whose unit was not damaged but had no running water smile did not provide any timeline and left people to figure out themselves marisa was the manager who backtracked on her words and communicated with tenants she claimed that can take as long as they can to fix things and that they are in no way responsible for paying for alternative accommodation while all of this happened they send generic messages like working tirelessy to getting things fixed asap with all effort while in reality there was minimal activity near apartment to fix things and they didnt even take the effort to dry out units and corridor leading to mold growth from the apparent musty smell also note that a lot of tenants in my building are new international students who dont completely know what their rights as a tenant are x200b what tenants did a fellow tenant who is smart enough to read the urbana ordinance contacted the city of urbana urbana ordinance says that if the landlord is not able to provide essential services or if the unit is uninhabitable the tenant can deduct average hotel price from rent the folks from urbana office of inspectors reached out promptly and informed the tenants that smile is absolutely responsible for providing alternatives until the damages in the unit is fixed and until the water is back up they also let smile know to stop misleading the tenants about their rights thanks mike nick from the city of urbana and thanks to my fellow tenants who spend time into collecting all info knowing the rights and reaching out to the city x200b fuck smile student living x200b edit i dont think this would have been so easy without the help of building inspectors from urbana i know its their job but they were really quick and patient with us if you can you should also send an email to michael frank mjfrankurbanaillinoisusmailtomjfrankurbanaillinoisus and nick hanson nphansonurbanaillinoisusmailtonphansonurbanaillinoisus letting them know how much you appreciate them helping out students and having our back imma stay in urbana until i graduate thanks mike and nick 3 x200b

2022-03-21 19:05:24,https://redd.it/tjpwpg,570,psa tiger sugar treats its workers very poorly,hi everyone here’s everything that happened at tiger sugar at tiger sugar we were promised 15 pay but it was changed to 13 without us knowing from the start we were never paid 15 we are also tasked with things that we are not supposed to even be doing over 10 workers have been “fired” and replaced with 2 fulltime chinese only speaking employees which is problematic when it comes to communicating properly with coworkers and customers they don’t know how to make drinks either we know when we are “fired” because our names do not show anymore on the schedule but we were never given benefits or told we were actually fired my poor manager who just quit was the only person really doing any work including orders and making drinks was overworked to the point where he was doing over 50 hours a week he never got overtime pay either it was way too much to handle and the owner wouldn’t lessen his responsibilities thanks for coming to my ted talk

2019-12-16 09:59:17,https://redd.it/ebgxnl,551,please be so safe this holiday season i was almost abducted,i work at a store at marketplace mall like i’m sure many of you do due to the weather last night many stores were closing early including mine i left for my bus stop around 800— like many freshman here i don’t have a car the bus is my only method of transportation again due to the weather some buses were not running or were 45 minutes to an hour off schedule i was stranded there were no cars in the parking lot that were anywhere close to me there was no bus coming anyone i could call to pick me up was at best 20 minutes away i called my boyfriend we are long distance just because i wanted his opinion on what to do wait who knows how long for the bus call a friend and risk them getting in an accident in the conditions walk it was around this time that a man in a dinky old white suv pulled up next to me and my bus stop on the edge of the parking lot he came out of no where or maybe i wasn’t paying close enough attention either way he was there and nobody else was exposed am i right i was talking to my boyfriend through my headphones so i guess the man didn’t realize i was on the phone at all he asked me if i needed a ride i told him no he asked again i told him no he scooted towards the passenger door told me that i could trust him told me it was cold and i was too pretty to be in the cold i told him no i told him goodbye he persisted this man was close enough to me that my boyfriend heard every end of the situation he heard how the man persisted calling me gorgeous— “you are so blessed to be that gorgeous you really are something sweetheart” he was still getting closer to the door and i still had no where to go he asked my name i told him a fake one he continued to persist ignoring my rejections “i would love to have someone as gorgeous as you in my car you really are something” he was too close to the passenger door now i didn’t know what to do i could’ve tried to run however there was snow and ice on the ground and i wasn’t in snow shoes he was bigger and probably stronger than me probably faster too i’m glad i didn’t find out it was at this time a couple of women from across the parking lot began to approach me when they were about halfway across the lot i heard them yell “ma’am are you okay” i looked at them and shook my head no as the man continued to try to coerce me into his car when they got a little closer i told the man “my friends are here for me now” he sped away the two women were very kind and offered me help and a ride home telling me how they knew something wasn’t right and how they witnessed a lot of the situation from across the lot i did not take their offer on a ride home most sex trafficking services work like that just when you think someone is there to help you they really are in on the scheme even though they seemed nice and genuine you can’t be too careful eventually a coworker who had been waiting for her ride on the other side of the mall spotted me and took me home had the two women and my coworker had not have been there i don’t know how my situation would have ended i’m sorry this is long but stuff like this is so important we have to be smart guys if you see something that you think looks wrong do something you could save someone like me from an unnecessary and dynamically dangerous situation happy holidays and god bless

2020-12-14 17:50:53,https://redd.it/kd9tp7,537,my thoughts on cs culture this semester,hear ye hear ye i am yet another salty cs student in this subreddit ready to complain cs culture may not deserve this much attention but given my personal experiences and upheavals this semester i think its high time i come out as disappointed when i was a freshman i felt like all of the people around me exuded obsession and prided themselves in it i stayed up all night just to finish my mp and as someone who suffers from test anxiety i always felt insecure for not obsessing over the mps or doing all that well on exams funnily enough i do like eating three meals a day going to bed at 1130 pm waking up at 9 am and talking about things besides internships what a shocker lol funnily enough i dont always need to flex in fact i probably put more effort into uplifting my friends than i do myself funnily enough i dont need to make inappropriate jokes just to make my friends laugh and i certainly dont need to make inappropriate jokes to think people like me funnily enough i dont need to dismiss peoples concerns about my attitude to maintain my ego i actually dont think theres anything wrong with apologizing accepting that i can always be kinder and more respectful and actively trying to be a better fucking person i think that this semester the cs culture has had an obnoxious flairup of douchery because of everything being online being online makes a lot of people feel like they can get away with certain bullshittery i wish this was an actual word and ive just seen a lot of indirect shade toxicity and just general negativity whether this is on piazza or in group chats ive felt isolated and annoyed at everyone around me at times at the same time im less tolerant and more vocal these days because i also use the internet to my own advantage ie i can be angry on the internet a lot easier than i can in real life i guess were all culprits in this manner but i digress because unlike a lot of the people around me ive never stopped trying to understand how to respect others and show kindness rather than defend themselves i lost a lot of fake friends this semester i lost someone who took their own life this summer i lost myself and am slowly rebuilding the things that make me me after years of dealing with anxiety and depression and finally gaining the strength to seek help i understand that i dont have to be ok with bullshit anymore yes to a certain extent speaking up all the time is obnoxious but im on the other end of that spectrum arent i im tired of the egoism toxic masculinity sexism racism and all forms of gaslighting in cs culture ive put up with it for two years and because of my career goals ill continue to put up with it for the rest of my life if my distaste means losing a lot of friends so be it i dont want to constantly be undermined and told that im overreacting and being mean for speaking up after months of feeling uncomfortable in a social setting im especially tired of hahaing obsession in this field working all day and all night does not make you a champ it simply means youre busy my peers left and right are flexing about dumb shit when in fact i lose respect for them the more they brag working hard isnt a bragging right but surviving is i just love how these people in my classes find new innovative technologically advanced strategies to tackling insecurities and the cs food chain this alienation of others of people who may not yet have a fucking junior year internship of people who may not come from a beautiful chicago suburb but in fact from a lowincome town of people who cant just hide their mental and physical scars like those who speak loudly has simply got to stop will it no probably not but to those who feel alienated right now youre not alone regardless of what the people with big sticks say were all fortunate to be here and were all doing our damn fucking best were trying to make this fucking world a better fucking place for future generations of humans dogs and all the animals were all meant to be here were all meant to be proud of ourselves and were all allowed to speak the hell up when someone brings you down please hit that like button and subscribe to literally nothing because i will never fucking do this again lol good luck with finals yall

2018-03-23 15:44:38,https://redd.it/86nzbe,526,as a 4th year ece student uiuc has completely scammed me,one of my most vivid childhood memories was riding on a train i still remember that particular trip boarding finding the sleeping space i’d share with my mother my heart pumping with excitement as the throttle of the engine began the steel walls of our cabin shook slowly but surely we left the light of the train station and then there was nothing to see in the outdoor darkness except for the moon surrounded by a halo of softly lit clouds the rocking of the train lulled me to sleep that night in the morning the same rhythmic rocking woke me the city i knew was gone by then outside was nothing except borderless grasslands that moment i felt that i belonged – in the train to no geographical location in particular but to everywhere since then i have dreamed of becoming an engineer i want to be the one driving the train and bringing smiles to peoples’ faces just like the engineer of that train did for me fast forward 12 years i was accepted into uiuc’s acclaimed ece program i was overjoyed there was something nostalgic about mechanical engineering the organic throttling of the steam engine but i knew society was ready to move on to sleek bulletnoses and sterile electric motors and automated announcers’ voices society wanted electric and computer engineers during my first semesters at uiuc i didn’t really get to take courses in ece most of my classes were just basics like physics and math the only mention of engineering during my first year came during a cs lecture where the professor used train cabins to explain doubly linked lists my second year i learned about circuits and electromagnetics no doubt important topics especially with the rising popularity of maglev technology some course subjects were very difficult for me to grasp but in the end through grit i managed to maintain a 36 gpa it was not until fall semester senior year when i realized something seemed off it was in my quantum electronics class the class barely had anything to do with engineering even moreso than my previous classes i was almost done with college at this point yet had never even set foot in a train none of my classes directly mentioned them i went to the counselor’s office in eceb and talked about how much i appreciated the classes building up my fundamentals but disliked never getting to the actual meat of engineering the counselor forgot her name told me that uiuc’s ece program didn’t cover actual traindriving she told me that engineering didnt mean the same thing as driving trains she said it without shame inside i broke i walked briskly out of the counselor’s office tears streaming down my face i did not pour my energy and time into this program for the past three years to hear something like that i headed back to my apartment sank into bed and slept because i didn’t know what else i could do it took a long time for me to recover emotionally i think i’m in a slightly better place now i’ve applied to a graduate electrical engineering program elsewhere and will be joining a group researching highspeed bus architectures i can’t quite understand their publications yet and i’m still mostly interested in trains but working with busses will be closer to traindriving than anything uiuc had to offer me for anyone else in the uiuc ece program who’s had their dreams dashed like me i send you my deepest sympathies

2020-09-02 12:51:07,https://redd.it/ilbp05,487,uiucs poor handling of covid cases,on friday august 28th my brother received the results back for his latest covid19 case he tested positive it was late at night when he received the news and naturally he began to freak out he and i are both on campus this semester and we had lunch the day before on the quad with our masks off we had both tested negative previously so we were unconcerned about one of us having it we have also been incredibly careful and rarely socializing with others so we thought a positive test was unlikely for the entire weekend my brother was trapped in his dorm no one from the school contacted or called him every hotline he called said they were closed were too busy to take his call or couldnt answer his questions as he does not have a roommate he was alone with no way to get food my roommate and i also quarantined though both of our recents tests have come back negative none of us had any idea what to do or where to go at around 730 monday night my brother finally got a call from cuphd telling him he had to leave his dorm in 15 minutes and get to a building on the other side of campus to quarantine when he asked how he was supposed to get there they told him to call an uber he not wanting to potentially infect someone packed up his backpack and trekked across campus in the dark they explained to him that in their system they did not have a positive test for him even though he got the message in safer illinois and mckinley that he tested positive they used that as an excuse as to why they did not contact him sooner on tuesday night cuphd called me and said that due to contact tracing i need to quarantine as well when i asked how i would get food they said that i should contact my ra so i did my ra said that i will have to move dorms to go to an isolation dorm but my roommate was allowed to stay in our dorm what if i do end up having covid that means its highly likely that my roommate has it too shouldnt she have to isolate with me as well it is now about noon on wednesday no one has contacted me or instructed me to move i dont know when i will have to leave or where i will go i have all my bags packed and i am now just sitting in my dorm insanely anxious constantly waiting for the phone call that would finally answer my questions since my roommate has not been ordered to quarantine she has been buying food for me at the cafeteria though we both have been staying inside as much as possible since we found out about my potential exposure on friday i dont know what to do i dont know where to go my ra has told me everything she knows which isnt much i just want some fucking instructions i dont even know if im allowed to go out to get retested im scared not just for me but for my brother and roommate as well uiuc has royally fucked up in this case and could have handled the situation a lot better i understand that this time is stressful and chaotic for everyone and that no one really knows how to handle the pandemic i just think they could have done better edit claritymore info update my brother told me that the one other person he had prolonged contact with around the time of his diagnosis has already been placed in an isolation dorm i still have not been given instructions on what to do i have called just about all the numbers i could find and they all either told me to call a different number said they couldn’t help me or were unavailable and i had to leave a message i’ll probably have to isolate in my dorm

2020-08-19 15:21:47,https://redd.it/icvkxn,486,ui receives fda approval for salivabased covid19 test first offered on campus,finally this is a big dealtm because it means our rapid test procedure can now be implemented statewide specifically through the local community around the university and throughout the state this meansk12 kids may actually be able to go back to school in person the university might be able to open all classes for inperson we can contact trace and isolate asymptomatic positives and maybe get this damn outbreak under control from wcia local news station httpswwwwciacomnewsuireceivesfdaapprovalforsalivabasedtestcovid19testfirstofferedoncampushttpswwwwciacomnewsuireceivesfdaapprovalforsalivabasedtestcovid19testfirstofferedoncampus chicago ill wcia — calling it “the best news that we’ve had since this pandemic” gov jb pritzker said the university of illinois at urbanachampaign has received “emergency use authorization” from the federal food and drug administration for its salivabased covid19 testing “this news puts the university of illinois and the entire state of illinois on the cutting edge of testing — of testing innovation as a national player” pritzker said “and let me just say to president tim killeen the state of illinois looks forward to your being to being your biggest customer” the fda approval allows the university system to “turbocharge” efforts to expand the testing beyond just the urbanachampaign campus which could include national expansion as well as expansion to schools of all types — higher education secondary and primary schools as well as public and private institutions — throughout the state “this is a critical new tool that we believe will let communities scale up their covid19 testing abilities rapidly in a way that is…affordable” chancellor robert jones said wednesday he cliacertified lab at the u of i performed a bridging study to a recently approved fda eua showing that the illinois test performs at least as well as the recently approved salivatesting protocol “direct saliva testing can address bottlenecks of time cost and supplies our test also has unique features that enable fast and frequent testing on a large scale and we are now working together with many partners to make our testing method broadly available as soon as possible” said dr martin burke earlier this month the executive committee of the university of illinois board of trustees created a new universityrelated organization as part of a broad effort to expand the reach of salivabased testing pioneered by u of i researchers that supports widespread testing with rapid results to limit the spread of the covid19 virus known as shield t3 the new organization will make the technology available nationally and was established in response to inquiries from universities and institutions across the country interest surged after researchers in urbanachampaign unveiled the technology to promote safety when oncampus instruction resumes later this month since then it has been expanded to the u of i system’s universities in chicago and springfield along with the new universityrelated organization the u of i system has already created a new internal unit that is working to make the tests available in illinois the unit known as shield illinois will continue building current testing capacity and hopes to ultimately offer testing to institutions and entities across the state the uiuc campus has nearly 20 different testing centers with two lines apiece each with the ability to collect 20000 tests per day copyright 2020 nexstar broadcasting inc all rights reserved

2020-11-16 20:00:37,https://redd.it/jvkb6t,486,uiuc being investigated for antisemitism thoughts as a jewish student,apparently following a student complain of widespread antisemitic practices and administrative inaction the department of education will be investigating the university of illinois for antisemitism httpswwwinsidehigheredcomnews20201026jewishstudentsuniversityillinoisallegeantisemiticenvironment see that doesnt track right with me look swastikas have been thrown up in different places and thats shit but the administration has taken reasonable steps against that what these students are complaining about is political action against israel political action that i support theres a friend of mine from high school who is without a doubt in the top five for smartest people ive ever met based on the raw speed at which her brain worked shes jewish very jewish and in fact is doing her undergrad in judaic studies did a birthright trip i got into a discussion with her about american support for israel and she basically said that i must have been brainwashed by antisemitic propaganda in order to disagree with israel and that made me sad because here is this brilliant young woman liberal as can be claiming that everything antiisraeli must be fake news or is offset by how israel sometimes does free heart surgeries for palestinians or something i am a jew like my father and my mother before me i was made bar mitzvah next to the western wall in israel wearing my grandfathers tallis i keep my dairy from my meat i do not eat pork and i have a tendency to make remarks in yiddish i am related by both blood and marriage to survivors of the holocaust who i have met and spoken to about their experience and furthermore i believe that israel as a state should exist but this shit thats going on now its wrong there is an international power with major influence in the levant that is using its superior military and economic backing to fuck over the native population and drive them from their homes all the while justifying the actions to themselves in the name of self defense and domestic security that was what the romans did to us two thousand years ago and we were bitter about it that entire time but suddenly we get our own country fresh from the horrors that can be inflicted when major powers wish to bully those with less influence and within a hundred years were doing to same to the palestinians i am a jew like my father and mother before me and that means that as a jew it befits me not to simply go along with what people tell me i should be but rather to try and fashion myself in the style of the jews that make me proud to be jewish and none of those are benjamin netanyahu they are people like abraham heschel who marched with mlk and moishe ben maimon who would continue working on shabbos if it meant he could treat more patients in his role as a physician regardless of their religion or status so when these students want to wholly conflate antiisraeli political sentiments with antisemitism what theyre really saying is if youre not rabidly in support of a country that engages in the indefensible youre not really a jew its underhanded and its fuckery of a high order so i say fuck em any jew that would rather support israels actions than give some sympathy to the palestinians has never really gotten what they shouldve out of pesach and from purim i do not believe in any way that the university of illinois is especially antisemitic given their track record of effectively and quickly denouncing and taking actions against legitimate antisemitic events that have occurred and believe that a senate resolution promoting a boycott of israeli products is not only non antisemitic but is basically wholly decent בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה blessed be thou the lord our god ruler of the universe who has kept us and preserved us and brought us to this time

2021-09-30 14:35:40,https://redd.it/pyr4qd,481,fuck the counseling center,i called the counseling center to talk with someone bc i was so depressed but they sent me to a mental hospital that kept me for 2 weeks the hospital refused to let me go even though i showed no signs of harming myself or others and now i might have to drop the semester and possibly drop my entire program here at u of i since im out of financial aid and time to graduate within the semester limit of my college now the counseling center is forcing me to complete four mandated risk assessments with them what am i going to tell them how could i ever be honest and get the help i need deserve without getting sent to a mental institution again the counseling center really thought it was a good idea to call the cops on me just for expressing suicidal ideation in passing during a phone call with a person i have never met before the counseling center needs to change calling the cops on a depressed person who just needed someone to talk to and then having them sent to a mental hospital that gave them anxiety and worse depression is not the answer i maybe could have avoided medical debt and worsened mental health if the counseling center had just listened to me andor given me resources to find a therapist in the area who could actually help me i am never ever going back to the counseling center after this if you feel suicidal or depressed and need someone to talk to dont call them unless you want to end up in a place like that

2023-08-04 12:26:02,https://redd.it/15i673g,457,psa about the dangers of uiuc,as an upperclassman and a townie i would like to take a moment to give some basic safety advice about living in the cu during the school year most of it is common sense but incidents happen every year that could have been avoided this is geared towards everyone but especially people engaging in nightlife 1 if you live in an apartment lock your doors at night breakins are unfortunately disproportionately common for a town this size but most of the time it’s burglars or homeless people simply walking into rooms where the door is unlocked don’t make it easy for them lock your doors 2 avoid walking alone at night no matter your gender mugging and assault is also relatively commonplace especially in the hours after the bars are closed 2am if you do find yourself alone text or call someone so that they can account for you then get inside and pay attention while going home 3 for the love of god swt do not get a ride from a stranger unless it’s an uber driver especially international students and women please even if it’s not a stranger if you’re not very close to someone you know and they randomly offer you a ride i’d err on the side of caution if someone claims to be a police officer and they’re not wearing uniform or in a police car turn the other way and briskly leaveyou’d rather be late then be dead trust mehttpsenmwikipediaorgwikimurderofyingyingzhang 4 do not put your hands on the bouncers at the bars should be common sense but there have been multiple incidents of people both men and women getting the absolute dog shit beat out of them by bouncers think back to the first thing you learned in elementaryprimary school and keep your hands to yourself 5 avoid fighting in general you do not want to be arrested beaten up or worse arrests for fights have happened and so have stabbing and other escalationsif you wanna scratch your itch for violence join the boxing rso or a martial arts rso 🥊 6 lock your car electric scooter bike etc in fact if you can just keep your bike in your apartment otherwise use a sturdy thick metal lock not a flimsy rope lock and make sure to secure the front wheel 7 alcohol and leaning over balconies don’t mix 8 always know your exits when at a bar or party also know how you get home on your own from everywhere 9 keep your phone charged before going out so you can get home from wherever you are and so you can call 911 or uber if you need to 10 don’t ditch your friends that you went out with without letting them know you should look out for each other especially women chambana campus is not a more dangerous place than almost anywhere it’s just that criminals have a town full of young gullible often intoxicated targets so stuff happens be smart

quashed lying just increases the chances that school will be cancelled more people will get sick and some might die if you are not called by the university or public health call them there is a

and shaming just make contact tracing harder everybody wants to beat this thing back and that will not happen if they make everyone feel like shit and want to hide step three quarantine yourself immediatelyhttpswwwdphillinoisgovcovid19communityguidancehomequarantineguidance if you have a roommates warn them it is extremely not cool to expose someone whose life is in your hands do not go to class do not go out and mingle do not go out to eat do not get on a bus or call an uber do not go sit out in your shared living room to watch tv do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars no not even if that cute chick from that night texts for a 2am bootie call with emojis you are grounded for at least the next ten days if you test positive 14 if you do not nor show symptoms thank your lucky stars if this is the worst thing that happens to you if you are the roommate of someone who has done this see this pagehttpscovid19illinoiseduhealthandsupportquarantineandisolation for what you should do to keep yourself safe if you share the room and were there all night breathing the same air you should probably also quarantine to be safe make the exposee pay for the contactless delivery you will be enjoying for the next ten days dont be too hard on them they are likely freaking out and scared too step four do not immediately run to get tested you will likely not show up as positive yet it will likely take 34 days to test positive that is how long you are stuck alone in your room it does not mean you are not infectious treat yourself like the potential typhoid mary you are and keep your potentially plagueridden ass to home caveat to step four if you did not get tested upon arrival before you decided to go out and party go in the bathroom look in the mirror and slap yourself really hard for me you dumb selfish fuck then call the osf number above again that is 8336735669 they will tell you what to do it will likely be go get tested immediately at this spot and well let them know youre coming step five monitor yourself for symptoms every dayhttpscovid19illinoiseduhealthandsupportbasicpersonalactions osf will likely send you a kit take your temperature but dont think no temp means youre out of the woods up to 40 of people dont ever develop a temperature however a lot of people do develop severe diarrhea this is not on the list of symptoms probably because its so commonly caused by other things like food poisoning and kind of gross by severe i mean severe like you are afraid to leave the toilet severe you think you have dysentery severe you do not remember eating that severe if this happens you either have it or ate something bad in your drunken stupor either way warn anyone else to not use that bathroom if you have a communal one try and clean it up as best you can then call osf again the number is 8336735669 step six you wait take classes if you feel up to it online if you start feeling ill call osf with your symptoms once youve been tested once and assuming it comes back negative you are not out of the woods keep monitoring yourself for symptoms call osf 8336735669 if you start to feel bad roommates monitor your sick dumb housemate make sure they are alive every day strokes and heart attacks have been known to happen yes even in otherwise healthy young people dont assume theyre just ignoring you or sleeping in after 10 days you should get tested again if you get another negative test you are likely in the clear hold out for 14 days just in case if you possibly can i believe up to 21 days postexposure is the longest anyones gone before showing symptomstesting positive but that is rare however if you feel ill even after youve been cleared you should probably call osf once again 8336735669 just to be sure what happens if i test positive it depends seriously some people shed virus like a husky sheds furhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvhiqar93mey and never feel a thing some people completely lose their sense of smell and taste this is a telltale symptom some people drop dead of strokes or heart attacks it seems to cause a lot of blood clots kind of like the opposite of ebola most people feel anywhere from bad coldflu to jesus christ i think i just coughed up a piece of my lungbroke a rib kill me now some people recover without incident some people it lingers for months with seeming relapses of fevers aches coughing fuzzy headed thinking google covid brain myocarditis etc its basically a crap shoot which is why everyone is always screaming about wearing a mask and social distancing regardless the quarantine clock resets you are now in quarantine for the next 10 days anyone in your house who has been exposed to you is quarantined for 14 you should not leave your residenceisolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by cuphd important note for potentially infected and roommates thereof if you start to feel really bad like seriously ill you need to call 911 do not fuck around with this if like half your face goes numb or you lose the ability to move one side of your body or a limb or you suddenly develop a crushing blinding headache or chest pain or lose the ability to take a deep breath your lips turn blue or your extremities cold youre suddenly completely exhausted and unable to think roommates if the potential infected person suddenly starts acting weird slurring words seems out of it is unable to be roused their face droops on one side or they suddenly fall to the ground or start gasping for air call 911 immediately tell them youyour roommate may have covid and what happened i was not kidding about strokes and heart attacks once youve tested negative twice youre considered recovered yes even if you still feel like utter shit you at least cant get anyone else sick go to mckinley and get an antibody test its a blood draw to gain the coveted green screen on your safer illinois app note the green screen is only good for four days same as the orange screen they are working on a way to signify someone whos had it and recovered as some people continue to test positive for a long time after recovery dont assume you cant get it again its

2022-02-09 19:07:50,https://redd.it/sotba9,455,if you think that someone you know wants to end their life please reach out,contrary to popular belief the overwhelming abundance of research tells us that asking someone if they are thinking about suicide will not make them more suicidal the opposite is true the person may feel a sense of relief in just being able to talk openly about their mental health life circumstances and thoughts of suicide if you think someone wants to end their life please reach out to them and just ask if they are thinking about ending their life if someone you know has recently had a noticeable change in behaviors becoming more erratic looking disheveled becoming more secretive or closed off becoming more irritable they may be experiencing problems with their mental health reach out with neutral nonjudgmental observations hey i noticed you’ve been on edge lately like when you… example xyz how are you doing is something going on if the person is open to talking more ask open ended questions not yesno questions like how have you been doing how are you coping with stress tell me more about what’s been going on in your life how are your classes how are things at home normalize mental health struggles and thoughts of suicide they are common especially among college students most college students experience periods of anxiety and depression not talking about these things creates more stigma it can be hard but try not to generalize or minimize what the person is going through it can be painful to have someone make assumptions about your experiences when they make sweeping generalizations or when they try to make you feel better by saying it’s no big deal we can normalize these experiences without minimizing them or making assumptions about what peoples’ lived experiences have been like ask if the person is open to learning more about resources or help this shows you care about them but respect their autonomy if they are open to it help facilitate a connection walk them to the counseling center help make a phone call to the counseling center together help them make a connection to resources that might be a source of their stress eg financial aid office tutoring a grief and loss group listen sometimes people just need someone to hear them out reflect back what they are saying so it sounds like your classes have really been stressing you out what i’m hearing you say is that finances are a major source of stress for you while helpful national crisis lines are a last resort making a human connection with someone you know who is struggling can make a more immediate impact before a crisis situation like a suicide attempt occurs if someone is in crisis call 911 and tell the dispatcher it is a mental health emergency so that appropriate first responders are sent eg a trained crisis intervention team not a traffic cop if you are a student and experiencing mental health problems or are thinking of suicide you can reach out to your professors we will help you connect with resources and we can lessen the stress induced by artificial deadlines and unnecessary course requirements reach out if you think someone is thinking about suicide you might save their life

2021-09-10 10:18:17,https://redd.it/pln3lj,420,my older brother committed suicide four years ago my only remaining sibling my older sister is at risk i need to vent,i am a senior bachelor’s degreeseeking student typing this at 547 am in my cramped studio apartment since i am currently experiencing insomnia for the second time with possible preliminary symptoms of a severe anxiety disorder of some sort my heart is panging uncontrollably and i have cried five times in a row so far i am not sure why i am typing this right now my father is a schizophrenic my older brother committed suicide my junior year of high school after being diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder my older sister told me three days ago that she thought about committing suicide for the first time if i lose her too the last piece of my heart will be ripped out i don’t know what kind of person i might change into and i think i will slowly lose my remaining will to live if anyone is reading this i hope that this introduction will enable you to read through my life’s events because i think i am the only one who has the mental and emotional capacity in my estranged family left potentially to do things of this sort my father and mother were uneducated immigrants from china with the usual backstory of coming to america to “seek a better living” and refuge during the unstable period of mao zedong’s election shortly after settling they had two children two years apart around 19901992 my older brother and older sister the problem was that the child abuse forced my two siblings to become parentified as early as around the 3rd to 5th grade of elementary school my older brother bore the burden of stabilizing the family during this extremely vulnerable age such as learning to pay overdue house bills mediating my parent’s verbal arguments witnessing my father punching my mother in the face being forced to explain issues to police officers due to my parents’ language barriers and further things that children of that age should never bear witness nor be forced to do i was born on september 27 1999 this continued to worsen and worsen until my father’s schizophrenia manifested to its full extent for the first time when i was in preschool all i vaguely remember was my father during a manic episode destroying the entire house breaking apart every piece of furniture ripping the doors apart etc my grandmother crying in fear she was living within our basement at the time and a blur in which my older brother carried me in his arms outside to protect me my mother and my older sister due to the instability of my memories at the time as i was far too young my older sister has always told me time and again how my older brother confronted my father to protect us only for my father to say “you are not my son” to him this was the tipping point my father was hospitalized time and time again whenever his prodromal period would end all throughout this elementaryschool phase for my siblings and myself my mother was always the sole breadwinner and she would work multiple part time jobs on and off such as in candymanufacturing factories or as an assembly worker for a trafficlight production company a job she has held for about two decades and currently has now she is a hard worker unfortunately sometimes that is not enough i love her and care for her hell i even loved and cared for my father to an extent but there are times where i inevitably wish she had the capability to divorce my father take her children and run away at this time my brother graduated and attended whitney young magnet high school my sister attended jones college prep and i worked my way up to the eighth grade in a uselessly disgustingly prejudiced “gifted program” i was forcibly assigned to by the school i believe that my brain subconsciously disables and blurs memories of this period as a selfdefense mechanism but there was probably continuous physical abuse emotional abuse and neglect of the sort mentioned prior however for this period it would also include the deterioration of my older brother’s mental health he would soon develop multiple different anxiety disorders he never obtained a professional diagnosis at this time but i am using my own observations to best explain what i witnessed he became obsessed with gaming as an extremely detrimental coping mechanism and would play upwards to 12 hours a day or more while also quickly becoming angered whenever provoked this anger would soon turn into something along the lines of intermittent explosive disorder as a psychology major i always hate assigning disorders loosely with criteria but i must do this for the sake of befitting synopsis and succinctness once my brother and sister graduated they then went to college at uiuc where before they left they comforted me as i cried despite being in eighth grade i don’t know why i cried i like to think it was because i would miss them but perhaps there was also fear reluctance and the beginning of my abandonment issues while they were gone to uiuc i successfully entered whitney young also i know that this is a horrible mentality but i felt that it was my responsibility as the youngest child who bore “the least trauma” to therefore mediate my two parents while my older siblings were busy attempting to forge their own lives despite our abused upbringing what i didn’t know was that behind the scenes my older brother’s mental state was still worsening while my older sister had to ironically bear another form of abuse from him while somehow maintaining her own sanity and grades my brother obviously graduated first with a bachelor’s degree in economics but when he returned he immediately began to experience a period of dissociation while trying his best to fix himself jumping from parttime job to parttime job until he couldn’t endure it anymore he eventually destroyed the home punching holes in the doorwall etc just as our father did and i blamed him for it i hated him at the time i would run away to seek refuge at the local park in the local library or even camp inside the 24hours cvs pharmacy every day after high school since i was fearful of seeing my own older brother when i inevitably had to return home late at night i would try my best to mediate between my brother and father since my father would trigger his episodes i tried my best to handle everything since i wanted my sister to fully focus on herself her education and for her to at least have the ability to finish her degree and focus on her own life with temporary relief from our living hell at the time but soon after my brother said he wanted to kill himself i couldn’t take it anymore and broke down one night when i had a video call with my older sister she was forced to come back and forth between college and home multiple times to help with interventions once my sister graduated with her bachelor’s in food science and human nutrition my brother tried his best to stabilize the three of us began to get together at the local library to help research and contact apartments to quickly move our mother out and try to forge our own lives and fix everything for our family eventually we successfully convinced and moved our mom out then my sister moved out after my father broke her last straw by “disowning her” despite her leaving of her own accord technically during his prodromal stage then it was just me my older brother and father a few weeks later my older brother looked me in the eyes with a distraught expression that i can still somehow vividly remember even now so i put on my most assured but fake smile and told him that everything would be okay i told him that he could leave too i said that i could handle our father since as the youngest child our dad never really did and would not do anything to me so far it might seem like i hated my older brother but no i do still love him even now while he is gone from this world already fuck tears are falling down uncontrollably now already again fuck my brother mother and sister pitched together to move into an apartment closer to where i was currently living alone with my father i would spend the days performing chores to help my mentally unsound father going to a tutoring gig concentrating on ap classes and inevitably visiting my siblingsmother without letting my father know every month or so this continued until my junior year of highschool i woke up with a call from my older sister one day she didn’t tell me what was wrong but insisted that i needed to come see her and our mother my heart was palpitating when i ran to the bus stop everyone in the bus stared at me as if i was an insane person as i kept trying to speak to myself to calm down i was in denial i was hopeful i kept making excuses such as how my sister would have told me outright if what i was thinking was truly the case i broke down immediately when i found out he committed suicide by hanging in the basement of their apartment what was worse was how he attempted to see me one last time the night before but i was gone tutoring late the last time i had seen him was a month before his fucking suicide where he asked awkwardly if i could hug him our family has never shown each other true affection so i brushed it off like a fucking idiot why didn’t i do so and then take a walk to the park like we used to do when i was young before things went to shit after he committed suicide i mustered my courage and went with my older sister to confront our father about what happened my sister also a hard worker was struggling and working a job three hours away in commute while facing her own crises so after our father seemingly broke down but recovered she left me back alone with him for the next several days however my father’s condition again was triggered and worsened he began to experience tics perseveration and other schizophrenic symptomatology since it was worsening my sister was forced to come back from her work to stay overnight to keep me safe the next day she told me to stay put as she confronted him to find that he had been cutting himself on the wrists that night before running upstairs and saying that we had to leave my father ran after us stating that he and i should die together to “join my older brother” we went to the police station temporarily to see if he would follow us in before carefully taking the train to my high school the more i explain this the more i feel numb i am elongating this far too much i know but my emotions are turbulent and i need to vent my sister and i explained everything to all the counselors there who then contacted dcfs where i eventually after endless court cases became a ward of the state we obtained a restraining order while being forced to abandon our father and his side of the family for our own safety we moved far away with our mother to seek refuge and try to recover ourselves since i shortly entered uiuc my older sister was forced to handle the funeral arrangements arguments with my slightly abusive mother verbal abuse is nevertheless abuse and her attempts to find another job unfortunately she has been unemployed for almost six years four years were wasted fixing things for this broken family the other two years were her hard work and efforts to find new skills such as successfully obtaining certification from a uiux academy since she realized how she hated dietetics my sister is the most resilient pragmatic and capable person i know but two years of job interviewers turning her down have hurt her she’s tried her best it’s either she explains the truth behind her unemployment gap to employers or she doesn’t if she does tell the truth what kind of employers would want someone with this type of fucked up background and upbringing if she doesn’t tell the truth how can she possibly keep putting up a fake face and smile that destroys her mental health further three days ago my mother was crying as she told my sister that we are going to be in thousands of dollars of debt and potentially tens of thousands of dollars of debt in the future due to building code violations in the old house with endless traumatic memories that my father has resided in the past two years my mother’s name is still on the deed since she never divorced our father out of both fear and lack of education he has apparently been hoarding trash around the entire sidewalk and destroying the property this entire time likely due to his condition the court has docket photos that have made this evident this debt has implicated us obviously since her name is on the deed my mother in her desperation attempted to reconnect and call one of our relatives we trust my older cousin to finally take matters into her own hands and get a divorce with my father this was already an insane risk for obvious reasons and one of our final options and last resort the call back was gaslighting stating that my mother should come back and be with my father that my older sister is an adult and should know how to take care of herself and that i should go back to apologize to my father my own father attempted to potentially murder me and i also lost my older brother due to complications with him none of them ever helped my family throughout every single one of my fathers or brothers episodes in fact i remember my father handing one of my cousins his cash from his wallet during an instance in which his symptoms flared up one time in which they didn’t even pause as they took his money without question how dare they how dare they have the gall to tell us what to do when so much has been practically taken and lost from us right now i am stuck here in college while my sister is about to meet with our last hope a lawyer to consult about whether “quit claim deeds” require the grantee’s signature so that hopefully we can just cut off the property and future debt payments without needing to meet our father physically obviously my mother has to change her phone number also to avoid being potentially harassed stalked or even worse by our father as my sister and i suspected but hoped would not be the case our relatives on our father’s side are cut off from our lives now my sister broke down in a call with me last night saying that she doesn’t know how much more she can take that she feels stuck but knows she has to live and keep surviving for my own sake she knows this but she told me that she had to let me know that she thought of suicide for the first time uncontrollably my sister and i have almost no support systems my sister and i have no close relationships with any relatives my sister has no friends and has estranged herself from all coworkers the past eight years for the reasons i stated above our fortitude and attempts to even live… to live happily… and to live normally have taken a toll over time there is only so much resilience a person can have no matter how much we attempt to escape our past issues always come up that implicate us to remind us that we will never be able to have actual happiness i have witnessed too much that has whittled away my faith and will to live slowly by no means am i extrapolating this to every policeman but i have witnessed officers laughing at my father’s manic episode and abandoning the premises as the three children cried i have witnessed the failure of this country’s mental healthcare system when my brother and father were hospitalized multiple times but released without proper treatment as they signed themselves out by no means am i fully aware of our mental healthcare policies but what i do know is that it did not help avoid this current situation when i was young i witnessed my sister’s high school “friends” laugh at her issues and say that they didn’t believe her that even if the issues were real they couldn’t do anything to help i have witnessed abandonment by my relatives abandonment by my own family at times but i forgive them the suicide of my brother who was forced to face facets of abuse and adulthood ever since he was only fucking eight years old the struggles and attempts to live by my sister and the agingsuffering of my mother from losing her firstborn by suicide i have visited three therapists one by reaching out to my own caseworker before i “exited” the dcfs system one of my own volitionsearch near my home and one here on campus after attempting to make an appointment three times in a row all three would look in disbelief as i divulged everything while unintentionally having me brush over my issues via generalizing questionscommentary i know they probably meant well and perhaps i have confirmation biases of my own perhaps i simply need to keep reaching out however none have helped nor provided tangible resourcessuggestions i have witnessed some school faculty i will not disclose names for obvious reasons in my high school purposefully avoid me simply on the basis of my problems and struggles once it became known one of them who helped comfort me at the crisis of my dad’s breakdown also didn’t say anything and went the other direction with a fearful expression when i encountered them in the hallway coincidentally weeks later i can’t forget that moment for some reason my sister always would laugh in selfridicule saying that technically not once has our family ever had a happy memory i would argue that us three siblings did have memories that i still try to cling onto but i can’t help but cry sometimes when i remember how she told me that she can’t actually remember some of them whether it is due to her trauma or some other sort of mental facet i don’t know what to do i don’t i can’t anymore maybe some part of me still has an inkling of hope left that allows me to subsist today i will wait for my sister to convey information about the lawyer if worse comes to worst i need to hurry and graduate so i can move out with my sister i also hope that i can keep contact and help my mother out simultaneously if the issue is resolvable but i am distraught right now my sister and i always wanted us three siblings to one day just live together and try to help lift each other back on our feet i don’t want to abandon that dream we had when young i don’t want to lose her too i realized that i haven’t valued enough time havent spent enough experiences and truly have not taken what i have remaining for granted prior to this point if you have read to this point thank you i want to at least leave some remembrance even if anonymously perhaps for my older brother ive lost perhaps for my own sake or to simply keep myself from deteriorating further at this moment i know that this is probably futile and that i am probably only typing this to temporarily either preserve my sanity or give myself solace i think i am a resilient person but to a detriment maybe i will later regret making this post or writing this to begin with my family has always been fearful and distrustful of divulging any of our history i am tired of it being kept inside me i probably will try to reach out for the first time and reveal everything for the first time to the only few individuals i might be able to trust the truth is however i am always afraid to reach out i still dont even know why i am typing this right now for some reason the rational or maybe hopeful side of me is saying to stop typing and delete this the rational side of me is saying that my resilient sister will be fine and that she will recover just like the times before when she broke down the tens of times before that maybe i will just laugh at what i am doing right now in the future if things somehow work out but no i know that is wrong and that i should not be ashamed nor scared to reveal my past anymore that is part of the problem in my way of thinking in my familys way of thinking that may have led to this point regardless again to anyone who somehow has taken the time to listen thank you for hearing me out

2020-08-26 13:44:48,https://redd.it/ih4prp,423,i have zero confidence that i am aware of all of my current assignments and responsibilities,ordinarily im sitting at around 20 confidence i am perpetually confused about many things all the time but in most cases i can at least bug the person next to me in lecture and ask hey do we have any quizzes or some shit is there homework due but now its just fuckall i think that i am currently on top of everything but i have no faith whatsoever that that is really the case every goddamn class website is labyrinthine im making a promise to myself if i ever end up as a university professor my course webpages are going to include at the top in bold a list of everything thats due every quiz thats coming up every prerecorded lecture and respective links to appropriate resources thats what people go to course pages for that should be at the top in front of your face
2020-06-18 11:42:03,https://redd.it/hbi7dh,419,for the love of god wear a mask,im a junior who lives on campus full time i went to the bookstore today to drop off a rental and on the way had to cross the main quad i saw one other student wearing a mask with plenty of other people walking around talking and socializing without one when i got to the bookstore two girls not wearing masks were leaving yall realize that coronavirus is still a thing right if the student body keeps acting like this the university might prohibit all in person classes and switch to 100 online no one wants that wear a mask if you go outside it doesnt just affect you ffs edit i understand you are not legally required to wear a mask if you are outside and six feet away from people legality is not the point of me saying this youre also not legally required to ever wash your hands but its better for everyone if you do
